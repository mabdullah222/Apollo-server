A relation is in first normal form if and only if no attribute domain has relations as elements.[1][2] Or more informally, that no table column can have tables as values. Database normalization is the process of representing a database in terms of relations in standard normal forms, where first normal is a minimal requirement. SQL-92 does not support creating or using table-valued columns, which means that using only the \"traditional relational database features\" (excluding extensions even if they were later standardized) most relational databases will be in first normal form by necessity. Database systems which do not require first normal form are often called NoSQL systems. Newer SQL standards like SQL:1999 have started to allow so called non-atomic types, which include composite types. Even newer versions like SQL:2016 allow JSON.\n\nOverview[edit]\n\t\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nIn a hierarchical database, a record can contain sets of child records \u2015 known as repeating groups or table-valued attributes. If such a data model is represented as relations, a repeating group would be an attribute where the value is itself a relation. First normal form eliminates nested relations by turning them into separate \"top-level\" relations associated with the parent row through foreign keys rather than through direct containment.[3]\n\nThe purpose of this normalization is to increase flexibility and data independence, and to simplify the data language.[4] It also opens the door to further normalization, which eliminates redundancy and anomalies.[5]\n\nMost relational database management systems do not support nested records, so tables are in first normal form by default. In particular, SQL does not have any facilities for creating or exploiting nested tables. Normalization to first normal form would therefore be a necessary step when moving data from a hierarchical database to a relational database.\n\nRationale[edit]\n\nThe rationale for normalizing to 1NF:[6]\n\nAllows presenting, storing and interchanging relational data in the form of regular two-dimensional arrays. Supporting nested relations would require more complex data structures.\nSimplifies the data language, since any data item can be identified just by relation name, attribute name and key. Supporting nested relations would require a more complex language with support for hierarchical data paths in order to address nested data items.\nRepresenting relationships using foreign keys is more flexible, where a hierarchical model only can represent one-to many relationships.\nSince locating data items is not directly coupled to the parent-child hierarchy, the database is more resilient to structural changes over time.\nMakes further normalization levels possible which eliminate data redundancy and anomalies.\nDrawbacks and criticism[edit]\n\t\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nPerformance worsens for certain operations. In a hierarchical model, nested records are physically stored after the parent record, which means a whole sub-tree can be retrieved in a single read operation. In a 1NF form, it will require a join operation per record type, which can be costly, especially for complex trees. For this reason document databases eschew 1NF.\nObject-oriented languages represent runtime state as trees or directed graphs of objects connected by pointers or references. This does not map cleanly to a 1NF relational database, a problem sometimes called the object-relational impedance mismatch and which object relational mapper (ORM) libraries try to bridge.\n1NF has been interpreted as not allowing complex data types for values. This is open to interpretation though, and C. J. Date has argued that values can be arbitrarily complex objects.[citation needed]\nHistory[edit]\n\nFirst normal form was introduced in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd in the paper A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks, although it was initially just called \"Normal Form\". It was renamed to \"First Normal Form\" when additional normal forms were introduced in the paper Further Normalization of the Relational Model in 1971.[7]\n\nExamples[edit]\n\nThe following scenarios first illustrate how a database design might violate first normal form, followed by examples that comply.\n\nDesigns that violate 1NF[edit]\n\nThis table over customers' credit card transactions does not conform to first normal form:\n\nCustomer\tCustomer ID\tTransactions\nAbraham\t1\t\nTransaction ID\tDate\tAmount\n12890\t2003-10-14\t\u221287\n12904\t2003-10-15\t\u221250\n\nIsaac\t2\t\nTransaction ID\tDate\tAmount\n12898\t2003-10-14\t\u221221\n\nJacob\t3\t\nTransaction ID\tDate\tAmount\n12907\t2003-10-15\t\u221218\n14920\t2003-11-20\t\u221270\n15003\t2003-11-27\t\u221260\n\nTo each customer corresponds a 'repeating group' of transactions. Such a design can be represented in a hierarchical database but not a SQL database, since SQL does not support nested tables.\n\nThe automated evaluation of any query relating to customers' transactions would broadly involve two stages:\n\nUnpacking one or more customers' groups of transactions allowing the individual transactions in a group to be examined, and\nDeriving a query result based on the results of the first stage\n\nFor example, in order to find out the monetary sum of all transactions that occurred in October 2003 for all customers, the system would have to know that it must first unpack the Transactions group of each customer, then sum the Amounts of all transactions thus obtained where the Date of the transaction falls in October 2003.\n\nOne of Codd's important insights was that structural complexity can be reduced. Reduced structural complexity gives users, applications, and DBMSs more power and flexibility to formulate and evaluate the queries. A more normalized equivalent of the structure above might look like this:\n\nDesigns that comply with 1NF[edit]\n\nTo bring the model into the first normal form, we can perform normalization. Normalization (to first normal form) is a process where attributes with non-simple domains are extracted to separate stand-alone relations. The extracted relations are amended with foreign keys referring to the primary key of the relation which contained it. The process can be applied recursively to non-simple domains nested in multiple levels.[8]\n\nIn this example, Customer ID is the primary key of the containing relations and will therefore be appended as foreign key to the new relation:\n\nCustomer\tCustomer ID\nAbraham\t1\nIsaac\t2\nJacob\t3\nCustomer ID\tTransaction ID\tDate\tAmount\n1\t12890\t2003-10-14\t\u221287\n1\t12904\t2003-10-15\t\u221250\n2\t12898\t2003-10-14\t\u221221\n3\t12907\t2003-10-15\t\u221218\n3\t14920\t2003-11-20\t\u221270\n3\t15003\t2003-11-27\t\u221260\n\nIn the modified structure, the primary key is {Customer ID} in the first relation, and {Customer ID, Transaction ID} in the second relation.\n\nNow each row represents an individual credit card transaction, and the DBMS can obtain the answer of interest, simply by finding all rows with a Date falling in October, and summing their Amounts. The data structure places all of the values on an equal footing, exposing each to the DBMS directly, so each can potentially participate directly in queries; whereas in the previous situation some values were embedded in lower-level structures that had to be handled specially. Accordingly, the normalized design lends itself to general-purpose query processing, whereas the unnormalized design does not.\n\nIt is worth noting that this design meets the additional requirements for second and third normal form.\n\nAtomicity[edit]\n\nEdgar F. Codd's definition of 1NF makes reference to the concept of 'atomicity'. Codd states that the \"values in the domains on which each relation is defined are required to be atomic with respect to the DBMS.\"[9] Codd defines an atomic value as one that \"cannot be decomposed into smaller pieces by the DBMS (excluding certain special functions)\"[10] meaning a column should not be divided into parts with more than one kind of data in it such that what one part means to the DBMS depends on another part of the same column.\n\nHugh Darwen and Chris Date have suggested that Codd's concept of an \"atomic value\" is ambiguous, and that this ambiguity has led to widespread confusion about how 1NF should be understood.[11][12] In particular, the notion of a \"value that cannot be decomposed\" is problematic, as it would seem to imply that few, if any, data types are atomic:\n\nA character string would seem not to be atomic, as the RDBMS typically provides operators to decompose it into substrings.\nA fixed-point number would seem not to be atomic, as the RDBMS typically provides operators to decompose it into integer and fractional components.\nAn ISBN would seem not to be atomic, as it includes language and publisher identifier.\n\nDate suggests that \"the notion of atomicity has no absolute meaning\":[13][14] a value may be considered atomic for some purposes, but may be considered an assemblage of more basic elements for other purposes. If this position is accepted, 1NF cannot be defined with reference to atomicity. Columns of any conceivable data type (from string types and numeric types to array types and table types) are then acceptable in a 1NF table\u2014although perhaps not always desirable; for example, it may be more desirable to separate a Customer Name column into two separate columns as First Name, Surname.\n\n1NF tables as representations of relations[edit]\n\nAccording to Date's definition, a table is in first normal form if and only if it is \"isomorphic to some relation\", which means, specifically, that it satisfies the following five conditions:[15]\n\nThere's no top-to-bottom ordering to the rows.\nThere's no left-to-right ordering to the columns.\nThere are no duplicate rows.\nEvery row-and-column intersection contains exactly one value from the applicable domain (and nothing else).\nAll columns are regular [i.e. rows have no hidden components such as row IDs, object IDs, or hidden timestamps].\n\nViolation of any of these conditions would mean that the table is not strictly relational, and therefore that it is not in first normal form.\n\nExamples of tables (or views) that would not meet this definition of first normal form are:\n\nA table that lacks a unique key constraint. Such a table would be able to accommodate duplicate rows, in violation of condition 3.\nA view whose definition mandates that results be returned in a particular order, so that the row-ordering is an intrinsic and meaningful aspect of the view. (Such views cannot be created using SQL that conforms to the SQL:2003 standard.) This violates condition 1. The tuples in true relations are not ordered with respect to each other.\nA table with at least one nullable attribute. A nullable attribute would be in violation of condition 4, which requires every column to contain exactly one value from its column's domain. This aspect of condition 4 is controversial. It marks an important departure from Codd's later vision of the relational model,[16] which made explicit provision for nulls.[17] First normal form, as defined by Chris Date, permits relation-valued attributes (tables within tables). Date argues that relation-valued attributes, by means of which a column within a table can contain a table, are useful in rare cases.[18]\nSee also[edit]\nAttribute-value system\nSecond normal form (2NF)\nThird normal form (3NF)\nFourth normal form (4NF)\nFifth normal form (5NF)\nSixth normal form (6NF)\nReferences[edit]\n^ Codd, E.F (1970). \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".

This involves structuring data into smaller, logically related tables and defining relationships between them to streamline data storage and retrieval.\n\nNormal Forms are a set of guidelines in database normalization that define how to structure data in tables to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. Each normal form builds on the previous one, progressively organizing data more efficiently.\n\nLevels of Normalization\n\nThere are various levels of normalization. These are some of them:\u00a0\n\nFirst Normal Form (1NF)\nSecond Normal Form (2NF)\nThird Normal Form (3NF)\nBoyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)\nFourth Normal Form (4NF)\nFifth Normal Form (5NF)\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the First Normal Form (1NF).\u00a0\n\nFirst Normal Form\n\nIf a relation contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the first normal form, or the relation is in the first normal form if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is single-valued attribute.\u00a0\n\nA table is in 1 NF if:\u00a0\n\nThere are only Single Valued Attributes.\nAttribute Domain does not change.\nThere is a unique name for every Attribute/Column.\nThe order in which data is stored does not matter.\nRules for First Normal Form (1NF) in DBMS\n\nTo follow the First Normal Form (1NF) in a database, these simple rules must be followed:\n\n1. Every Column Should Have Single Values\nEach column in a table must contain only one value in a cell. No cell should hold multiple values. If a cell contains more than one value, the table does not follow 1NF.\n\nExample: A table with columns like [Writer 1], [Writer 2], and [Writer 3] for the same book ID is not in 1NF because it repeats the same type of information (writers). Instead, all writers should be listed in separate rows.\n\n2. All Values in a Column Should Be of the Same Type\nEach column must store the same type of data. You cannot mix different types of information in the same column.\n\nExample: If a column is meant for dates of birth (DOB), you cannot use it to store names. Each type of information should have its own column.\n\n3. Every Column Must Have a Unique Name\nEach column in the table must have a unique name. This avoids confusion when retrieving, updating, or adding data.\n\nExample: If two columns have the same name, the database system may not know which one to use.\n\n4. The Order of Data Doesn\u2019t Matter\nIn 1NF, the order in which data is stored in a table doesn\u2019t affect how the table works. You can organize the rows in any way without breaking the rules.\n\nExample:\u00a0\n\nConsider the below COURSES Relation :\n\nIn the above table, Courses has a multi-valued attribute, so it is not in 1NF. The Below Table is in 1NF as there is no multi-valued attribute.\nConclusion\n\nIn Conclusion, First Normal Form (1NF) is a key idea in relational database architecture. It guarantees that data is organized to facilitate data processing, remove redundancy, and support data integrity. 1NF establishes the foundation for more complex normalization strategies that further improve the correctness and efficiency of database systems by imposing atomic values and forbidding recurring groupings inside rows.\n\n\n\nComment\nMore info\nAdvertise with us\nNext Article \nSecond Normal Form (2NF)\nSimilar Reads\nDBMS Tutorial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Learn Database Management System\nDatabase Management System (DBMS) is a software used to manage data from a database.
