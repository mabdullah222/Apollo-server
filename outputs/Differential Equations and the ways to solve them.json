Section  Notes  Next Section \n\u00a0\nSection 2.2 : Separable Equations\n\nWe are now going to start looking at nonlinear first order differential equations. The first type of nonlinear first order differential equations that we will look at is separable differential equations.\n\nA separable differential equation is any differential equation that we can write in the following form.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}N\\left( y \\right)\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} = M\\left( x \\right)\\label{eq:eq1} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nNote that in order for a differential equation to be separable all the \\(y\\)'s in the differential equation must be multiplied by the derivative and all the \\(x\\)'s in the differential equation must be on the other side of the equal sign.\n\nTo solve this differential equation we first integrate both sides with respect to \\(x\\) to get,\n\n\\[\\int{{N\\left( y \\right)\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}}\\,dx}} = \\int{{M\\left( x \\right)\\,dx}}\\]\n\nNow, remember that \\(y\\) is really \\(y\\left( x \\right)\\) and so we can use the following substitution,\n\n\\[u = y\\left( x \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}du = y'\\left( x \\right)\\,dx = \\frac{{dy}}{{dx}}\\,dx\\]\n\nApplying this substitution to the integral we get,\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\int{{N\\left( u \\right)\\,du}} = \\int{{M\\left( x \\right)\\,dx}} \\label{eq:eq2} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nAt this point we can (hopefully) integrate both sides and then back substitute for the \\(u\\) on the left side. Note, that as implied in the previous sentence, it might not actually be possible to evaluate one or both of the integrals at this point. If that is the case, then there won\u2019t be a lot we can do to proceed using this method to solve the differential equation.\n\nNow, the process above is the mathematically correct way of solving this differential equation. Note however, that if we \u201cseparate\u201d the derivative as well we can write the differential equation as,\n\n\\[N\\left( y \\right)dy = M\\left( x \\right)dx\\]\n\nWe obviously can\u2019t separate the derivative like that, but let\u2019s pretend we can for a bit and we\u2019ll see that we arrive at the answer with less work.\n\nNow we integrate both sides of this to get,\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\int{{N\\left( y \\right)dy}} = \\int{{M\\left( x \\right)dx}} \\label{eq:eq3} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nSo, if we compare \\(\\eqref{eq:eq2}\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\) we can see that the only difference is on the left side and even then the only real difference is \\(\\eqref{eq:eq2}\\) has the integral in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\) has the integral in terms of \\(y\\). Outside of that there is no real difference. The integral on the left is exactly the same integral in each equation. The only difference is the letter used in the integral. If we integrate \\(\\eqref{eq:eq2}\\) and then back substitute in for \\(u\\) we would arrive at the same thing as if we\u2019d just integrated \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\) from the start.\n\nTherefore, to make the work go a little easier, we\u2019ll just use \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\) to find the solution to the differential equation. Also, after doing the integrations, we will have an implicit solution that we can hopefully solve for the explicit solution, \\(y(x)\\). Note that it won't always be possible to solve for an explicit solution.\n\nRecall from the Definitions section that an implicit solution is a solution that is not in the form \\(y = y\\left( x \\right)\\) while an explicit solution has been written in that form.\n\nWe will also have to worry about the interval of validity for many of these solutions. Recall that the interval of validity was the range of the independent variable, \\(x\\) in this case, on which the solution is valid. In other words, we need to avoid division by zero, complex numbers, logarithms of negative numbers or zero, etc. Most of the solutions that we will get from separable differential equations will not be valid for all values of \\(x\\).\n\nLet\u2019s start things off with a fairly simple example so we can see the process without getting lost in details of the other issues that often arise with these problems.\n\nExample 1 Solve the following differential equation and determine the interval of validity for the solution. \\[\\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} = 6{y^2}x\\hspace{0.25in}\\,\\,\\,y\\left( 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{{25}}\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 2 Solve the following IVP and find the interval of validity for the solution. \\[y' = \\frac{{3{x^2} + 4x - 4}}{{2y - 4}}\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( 1 \\right) = 3\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 3 Solve the following IVP and find the interval of validity of the solution. \\[y' = \\frac{{x{y^3}}}{{\\sqrt {1 + {x^2}} }}\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( 0 \\right) = - 1\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 4 Solve the following IVP and find the interval of validity of the solution. \\[y' = {{\\bf{e}}^{ - y}}\\left( {2x - 4} \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( 5 \\right) = 0\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 5 Solve the following IVP and find the interval of validity for the solution. \\[\\frac{{dr}}{{d\\theta }} = \\frac{{{r^2}}}{\\theta }\\hspace{0.25in}r\\left( 1 \\right) = 2\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 6 Solve the following IVP. \\[\\frac{{dy}}{{dt}} = {{\\bf{e}}^{y\\, - \\,t}}\\sec \\left( y \\right)\\left( {1 + {t^2}} \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( 0 \\right) = 0\\]\nShow Solution \n\nAs this last example showed it is not always possible to find explicit solutions so be on the lookout for those cases.\n\n[Contact Me]\u00a0[Privacy Statement]\u00a0[Site Help & FAQ]\u00a0[Terms of Use]\n\u00a9 2003 - 2025 Paul Dawkins\nPage Last Modified : 2/6/2023\n\nLoading [MathJax]/extensions/mml2jax.js\nSkip to main content\nchrome_reader_mode\nEnter Reader Mode\nSearch \n Search\nSign in\n Expand/collapse global hierarchy\n Home   Bookshelves   Algebra   Intermediate Algebra 1e (OpenStax)   11: Conics   11.6: Solving Systems of Nonlinear Equations\n Expand/collapse global location\n11.6: Solving Systems of Nonlinear Equations\n11.5E: Exercises\n \n11.6E: Exercises\nOpenStax\nOpenStax\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nSolve a system of nonlinear equations using graphing\nSolve a system of nonlinear equations using substitution\nSolve a system of nonlinear equations using elimination\nUse a system of nonlinear equations to solve applications\n\nBefore you get started, take this readiness quiz.\n\nSolve the system by graphing: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{x-3 y=-3} \\\\ {x+y=5}\\end{array}\\right.\\).\nIf you missed this problem, review Example 4.2.\nSolve the system by substitution: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{x-4 y=-4} \\\\ {-3 x+4 y=0}\\end{array}\\right.\\)\nIf you missed this problem, review Example 4.7.\nSolve the system by elimination: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{3 x-4 y=-9} \\\\ {5 x+3 y=14}\\end{array}\\right.\\)\nIf you missed this problem, review Example 4.9.\nSolve a System of Nonlinear Equations using Graphing\n\nWe learned how to solve systems of linear equations with two variables by graphing, substitution and elimination. We will be using these same methods as we look at nonlinear systems of equations with two equations and two variables. A system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear.\n\nFor example each of the following systems is a system of nonlinear equations.\n\n\\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{x^{2}+y^{2}=9} \\\\ {x^{2}-y=9}\\end{array}\\right. \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{9 x^{2}+y^{2}=9} \\\\ {y=3 x-3}\\end{array}\\right. \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{x+y=4} \\\\ {y=x^{2}+2}\\end{array}\\right.\\)\n\nDefinition \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)\n\nA system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear.\n\nJust as with systems of linear equations, a solution of a nonlinear system is an ordered pair that makes both equations true. In a nonlinear system, there may be more than one solution. We will see this as we solve a system of nonlinear equations by graphing.\n\nWhen we solved systems of linear equations, the solution of the system was the point of intersection of the two lines. With systems of nonlinear equations, the graphs may be circles, parabolas or hyperbolas and there may be several points of intersection, and so several solutions. Once you identify the graphs, visualize the different ways the graphs could intersect and so how many solutions there might be.\n\nTo solve systems of nonlinear equations by graphing, we use basically the same steps as with systems of linear equations modified slightly for nonlinear equations. The steps are listed below for reference.\n\nSolve a System of Nonlinear Equations by Graphing.\nIdentify the graph of each equation.

But more often it is difficult to read the coordinates of the points of intersection. The substitution method is an algebraic method that will work well in many situations. It works especially well when it is easy to solve one of the equations for one of the variables.\n\nThe substitution method is very similar to the substitution method that we used for systems of linear equations.

We can also use elimination to solve systems of nonlinear equations. It works well when the equations have both variables squared. When using elimination, we try to make the coefficients of one variable to be opposites, so when we add the equations together, that variable is eliminated.\n\nThe elimination method is very similar to the elimination method that we used for systems of linear equations. The steps are listed for reference.\n\nSolve a System of Equations by Elimination\nIdentify the graph of each equation. Sketch the possible options for intersection.\nWrite both equations in standard form.\nMake the coefficients of one variable opposites.\nDecide which variable you will eliminate.\nMultiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.\nAdd the equations resulting from Step 3 to eliminate one variable.\nSolve for the remaining variable.\nSubstitute each solution from Step 5 into one of the original equations.

Section  Notes  Next Section \n\u00a0\nChapter 7 : Higher Order Differential Equations\n\nIn this chapter we\u2019re going to take a look at higher order differential equations. This chapter will actually contain more than most text books tend to have when they discuss higher order differential equations.\n\nWe will definitely cover the same material that most text books do here. However, in all the previous chapters all of our examples were 2nd order differential equations or \\(2 \\times 2\\) systems of differential equations. So, in this chapter we\u2019re also going to do a couple of examples here dealing with 3rd order or higher differential equations with Laplace transforms and series as well as a discussion of some larger systems of differential equations.\n\nHere is a brief listing of the topics in this chapter.\n\nBasic Concepts for \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) Order Linear Equations \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll start the chapter off with a quick look at some of the basic ideas behind solving higher order linear differential equations. Included will be updated definitions/facts for the Principle of Superposition, linearly independent functions and the Wronskian.\n\nLinear Homogeneous Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we will extend the ideas behind solving 2nd order, linear, homogeneous differential equations to higher order. As we\u2019ll most of the process is identical with a few natural extensions to repeated real roots that occur more than twice. We will also need to discuss how to deal with repeated complex roots, which are now a possibility. In addition, we will see that the main difficulty in the higher order cases is simply finding all the roots of the characteristic polynomial.\n\nUndetermined Coefficients \u2013 In this section we work a quick example to illustrate that using undetermined coefficients on higher order differential equations is no different that when we used it on 2nd order differential equations with only one small natural extension.\n\nVariation of Parameters \u2013 In this section we will give a detailed discussion of the process for using variation of parameters for higher order differential equations. We will also develop a formula that can be used in these cases. We will also see that the work involved in using variation of parameters on higher order differential equations can be quite involved on occasion.\n\nLaplace Transforms \u2013 In this section we will work a quick example using Laplace transforms to solve a differential equation on a 3rd order differential equation just to say that we looked at one with order higher than 2nd. As we\u2019ll see, outside of needing a formula for the Laplace transform of \\(y'''\\), which we can get from the general formula, there is no real difference in how Laplace transforms are used for higher order differential equations.\n\nSystems of Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll take a quick look at extending the ideas we discussed for solving \\(2 \\times 2\\) systems of differential equations to systems of size \\(3 \\times 3\\). As we will see they are mostly just natural extensions of what we already know how to do. We will also make a couple of quick comments about \\(4 \\times 4\\) systems.\n\nSeries Solutions \u2013 In this section we are going to work a quick example illustrating that the process of finding series solutions for higher order differential equations is pretty much the same as that used on 2nd order differential equations.\n\n[Contact Me]\u00a0[Privacy Statement]\u00a0[Site Help & FAQ]\u00a0[Terms of Use]\n\u00a9 2003 - 2025 Paul Dawkins\nPage Last Modified : 6/26/2023\n\nPaul's Online Notes\nNOTES  QUICK NAV  DOWNLOAD  \n\nHome / Differential Equations / Partial Differential Equations / Separation of Variables\n Prev. Section  Notes  Next Section \n\u00a0\nSection 9.4 : Separation Of Variables\n\nOkay, it is finally time to at least start discussing one of the more common methods for solving basic partial differential equations. The method of Separation of Variables cannot always be used and even when it can be used it will not always be possible to get much past the first step in the method. However, it can be used to easily solve the 1-D heat equation with no sources, the 1-D wave equation, and the 2-D version of Laplace\u2019s Equation, \\({\\nabla ^2}u = 0\\).\n\nIn order to use the method of separation of variables we must be working with a linear homogenous partial differential equations with linear homogeneous boundary conditions. At this point we\u2019re not going to worry about the initial condition(s) because the solution that we initially get will rarely satisfy the initial condition(s). As we\u2019ll see however there are ways to generate a solution that will satisfy initial condition(s) provided they meet some fairly simple requirements.\n\nThe method of separation of variables relies upon the assumption that a function of the form,\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}u\\left( {x,t} \\right) = \\varphi \\left( x \\right)G\\left( t \\right)\\label{eq:eq1}\\end{equation}\\]\n\nwill be a solution to a linear homogeneous partial differential equation in \\(x\\) and \\(t\\). This is called a product solution and provided the boundary conditions are also linear and homogeneous this will also satisfy the boundary conditions. However, as noted above this will only rarely satisfy the initial condition, but that is something for us to worry about in the next section.\n\nNow, before we get started on some examples there is probably a question that we should ask at this point and that is : Why? Why did we choose this solution and how do we know that it will work? This seems like a very strange assumption to make. After all there really isn\u2019t any reason to believe that a solution to a partial differential equation will in fact be a product of a function of only \\(x\\)\u2019s and a function of only \\(t\\)\u2019s. This seems more like a hope than a good assumption/guess.\n\nUnfortunately, the best answer is that we chose it because it will work. As we\u2019ll see it works because it will reduce our partial differential equation down to two ordinary differential equations and provided we can solve those then we\u2019re in business and the method will allow us to get a solution to the partial differential equations.\n\nSo, let\u2019s do a couple of examples to see how this method will reduce a partial differential equation down to two ordinary differential equations.\n\nExample 1 Use Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation. \\[\\begin{align*}& \\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial t}} = k\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {x^2}}}\\\\ & u\\left( {x,0} \\right) = f\\left( x \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( {0,t} \\right) = 0\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( {L,t} \\right) = 0\\end{align*}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nOkay, so just what have we learned here? By using separation of variables we were able to reduce our linear homogeneous partial differential equation with linear homogeneous boundary conditions down to an ordinary differential equation for one of the functions in our product solution \\(\\eqref{eq:eq1}\\), \\(G\\left( t \\right)\\) in this case, and a boundary value problem that we can solve for the other function, \\(\\varphi \\left( x \\right)\\) in this case.\n\nNote as well that the boundary value problem is in fact an eigenvalue/eigenfunction problem. When we solve the boundary value problem we will be identifying the eigenvalues, \\(\\lambda \\), that will generate non-trivial solutions to their corresponding eigenfunctions. Again, we\u2019ll look into this more in the next section. At this point all we want to do is identify the two ordinary differential equations that we need to solve to get a solution.\n\nBefore we do a couple of other examples we should take a second to address the fact that we made two very arbitrary seeming decisions in the above work. We divided both sides of the equation by \\(k\\) at one point and chose to use \\( - \\lambda \\) instead of \\(\\lambda \\) as the separation constant.\n\nBoth of these decisions were made to simplify the solution to the boundary value problem we got from our work. The addition of the \\(k\\) in the boundary value problem would just have complicated the solution process with another letter we\u2019d have to keep track of so we moved it into the time problem where it won\u2019t cause as many problems in the solution process. Likewise, we chose \\( - \\lambda \\) because we\u2019ve already solved that particular boundary value problem (albeit with a specific \\(L\\), but the work will be nearly identical) when we first looked at finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This by the way was the reason we rewrote the boundary value problem to make it a little clearer that we have in fact solved this one already.\n\nWe can now at least partially answer the question of how do we know to make these decisions. We wait until we get the ordinary differential equations and then look at them and decide of moving things like the \\(k\\) or which separation constant to use based on how it will affect the solution of the ordinary differential equations. There is also, of course, a fair amount of experience that comes into play at this stage. The more experience you have in solving these the easier it often is to make these decisions.\n\nAgain, we need to make clear here that we\u2019re not going to go any farther in this section than getting things down to the two ordinary differential equations. Of course, we will need to solve them in order to get a solution to the partial differential equation but that is the topic of the remaining sections in this chapter. All we\u2019ll say about it here is that we will need to first solve the boundary value problem, which will tell us what \\(\\lambda \\) must be and then we can solve the other differential equation. Once that is done we can then turn our attention to the initial condition.\n\nOkay, we need to work a couple of other examples and these will go a lot quicker because we won\u2019t need to put in all the explanations. After the first example this process always seems like a very long process but it really isn\u2019t. It just looked that way because of all the explanation that we had to put into it.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start off with a couple of more examples with the heat equation using different boundary conditions.\n\nExample 2 Use Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation. \\[\\begin{align*}&\\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial t}} = k\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {x^2}}}\\\\ & u\\left( {x,0} \\right) = f\\left( x \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}\\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial x}}\\left( {0,t} \\right) = 0\\hspace{0.25in}\\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial x}}\\left( {L,t} \\right) = 0\\end{align*}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nNext, let\u2019s see what we get if use periodic boundary conditions with the heat equation.\n\nExample 3 Use Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation. \\[\\begin{align*}& \\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial t}} = k\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {x^2}}}\\\\ & u\\left( {x,0} \\right) = f\\left( x \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( { - L,t} \\right) = u\\left( {L,t} \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}\\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial x}}\\left( { - L,t} \\right) = \\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial x}}\\left( {L,t} \\right)\\end{align*}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nLet\u2019s now take a look at what we get by applying separation of variables to the wave equation with fixed boundaries.\n\nExample 4 Use Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation. \\[\\begin{align*}& \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {t^2}}} = {c^2}\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {x^2}}}\\\\ & u\\left( {x,0} \\right) = f\\left( x \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}\\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial t}}\\left( {x,0} \\right) = g\\left( x \\right)\\\\ & u\\left( {0,t} \\right) = 0\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( {L,t} \\right) = 0\\end{align*}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at the 2-D Laplace\u2019s Equation.\n\nExample 5 Use Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation. \\[\\begin{align*} & \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {x^2}}} + \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {y^2}}} = 0\\hspace{0.25in}0 \\le x \\le L\\hspace{0.25in}0 \\le y \\le H\\\\ & u\\left( {0,y} \\right) = g\\left( y \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( {L,y} \\right) = 0\\\\ & u\\left( {x,0} \\right) = 0\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( {x,H} \\right) = 0\\end{align*}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nSo, we\u2019ve finally seen an example where the constant of separation didn\u2019t have a minus sign and again note that we chose it so that the boundary value problem we need to solve will match one we\u2019ve already seen how to solve so there won\u2019t be much work to there.\n\nAll the examples worked in this section to this point are all problems that we\u2019ll continue in later sections to get full solutions for. Let\u2019s work one more however to illustrate a couple of other ideas. We will not however be doing any work with this in later sections however, it is only here to illustrate a couple of points.\n\nExample 6 Use Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation. \\[\\begin{align*}& \\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial t}} = k\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}u}}{{\\partial {x^2}}} - u\\\\ & u\\left( {x,0} \\right) = f\\left( x \\right)\\hspace{0.25in}u\\left( {0,t} \\right) = 0\\hspace{0.25in} - \\frac{{\\partial u}}{{\\partial x}}\\left( {L,t} \\right) = u\\left( {L,t} \\right)\\end{align*}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nOn a quick side note we solved the boundary value problem in this example in Example 5 of the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section and that example illustrates why separation of variables is not always so easy to use. As we\u2019ll see in the next section to get a solution that will satisfy any sufficiently nice initial condition we really need to get our hands on all the eigenvalues for the boundary value problem. However, as the solution to this boundary value problem shows this is not always possible to do. There are ways (which we won\u2019t be going into here) to use the information here to at least get approximations to the solution but we won\u2019t ever be able to get a complete solution to this problem.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s it for this section. It is important to remember at this point that what we\u2019ve done here is really only the first step in the separation of variables method for solving partial differential equations. In the upcoming sections we\u2019ll be looking at what we need to do to finish out the solution process and in those sections we\u2019ll finish the solution to the partial differential equations we started in Example 1 \u2013 Example 5 above.\n\nAlso, in the Laplace\u2019s Equation section the last two examples show pretty much the whole separation of variable process from defining the product solution to getting an actual solution. The only step that\u2019s missing from those two examples is the solving of a boundary value problem that will have been already solved at that point and so was not put into the solution given that they tend to be fairly lengthy to solve.\n\nWe\u2019ll also see a worked example (without the boundary value problem work again) in the Vibrating String section.\n\n[Contact Me]\u00a0[Privacy Statement]\u00a0[Site Help & FAQ]\u00a0[Terms of Use]\n\u00a9 2003 - 2025 Paul Dawkins\nPage Last Modified : 11/16/2022\n\nPaul's Online Notes\nNOTES  QUICK NAV  DOWNLOAD  \n\nHome / Differential Equations\n Notes  Next Section \n\u00a0\nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\nHere are my notes for my differential equations course that I teach here at Lamar University. Despite the fact that these are my \u201cclass notes\u201d, they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn how to solve differential equations or needing a refresher on differential equations.\nI\u2019ve tried to make these notes as self-contained as possible and so all the information needed to read through them is either from a Calculus or Algebra class or contained in other sections of the notes.\nHere are a couple of warnings to my students who may be here to get a copy of what happened on a day that you missed.\n\nBecause I wanted to make this a fairly complete set of notes for anyone wanting to learn differential equations have included some material that I do not usually have time to cover in class and because this changes from semester to semester it is not noted here. You will need to find one of your fellow class mates to see if there is something in these notes that wasn\u2019t covered in class.\n\n\nIn general, I try to work problems in class that are different from my notes. However, with Differential Equation many of the problems are difficult to make up on the spur of the moment and so in this class my class work will follow these notes fairly close as far as worked problems go. With that being said I will, on occasion, work problems off the top of my head when I can to provide more examples than just those in my notes. Also, I often don\u2019t have time in class to work all of the problems in the notes and so you will find that some sections contain problems that weren\u2019t worked in class due to time restrictions.\n\n\nSometimes questions in class will lead down paths that are not covered here. I try to anticipate as many of the questions as possible when writing these up, but the reality is that I can\u2019t anticipate all the questions. Sometimes a very good question gets asked in class that leads to insights that I\u2019ve not included here. You should always talk to someone who was in class on the day you missed and compare these notes to their notes and see what the differences are.\n\n\nThis is somewhat related to the previous three items, but is important enough to merit its own item. THESE NOTES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ATTENDING CLASS!! Using these notes as a substitute for class is liable to get you in trouble. As already noted not everything in these notes is covered in class and often material or insights not in these notes is covered in class.\n\nHere is a listing (and brief description) of the material that is in this set of notes.\n\nBasic Concepts - In this chapter we introduce many of the basic concepts and definitions that are encountered in a typical differential equations course. We will also take a look at direction fields and how they can be used to determine some of the behavior of solutions to differential equations.\nDefinitions \u2013 In this section some of the common definitions and concepts in a differential equations course are introduced including order, linear vs. nonlinear, initial conditions, initial value problem and interval of validity.\nDirection Fields \u2013 In this section we discuss direction fields and how to sketch them. We also investigate how direction fields can be used to determine some information about the solution to a differential equation without actually having the solution.\nFinal Thoughts \u2013 In this section we give a couple of final thoughts on what we will be looking at throughout this course.\n\nFirst Order Differential Equations - In this chapter we will look at several of the standard solution methods for first order differential equations including linear, separable, exact and Bernoulli differential equations. We also take a look at intervals of validity, equilibrium solutions and Euler\u2019s Method. In addition we model some physical situations with first order differential equations.\nLinear Equations \u2013 In this section we solve linear first order differential equations, i.e. differential equations in the form \\(y' + p(t) y = g(t)\\). We give an in depth overview of the process used to solve this type of differential equation as well as a derivation of the formula needed for the integrating factor used in the solution process.\nSeparable Equations \u2013 In this section we solve separable first order differential equations, i.e. differential equations in the form \\(N(y) y' = M(x)\\). We will give a derivation of the solution process to this type of differential equation. We\u2019ll also start looking at finding the interval of validity for the solution to a differential equation.\nExact Equations \u2013 In this section we will discuss identifying and solving exact differential equations. We will develop a test that can be used to identify exact differential equations and give a detailed explanation of the solution process. We will also do a few more interval of validity problems here as well.\nBernoulli Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we solve Bernoulli differential equations, i.e. differential equations in the form \\(y' + p(t) y = y^{n}\\). This section will also introduce the idea of using a substitution to help us solve differential equations.\nSubstitutions \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll pick up where the last section left off and take a look at a couple of other substitutions that can be used to solve some differential equations. In particular we will discuss using solutions to solve differential equations of the form \\(y' = F(\\frac{y}{x})\\) and \\(y' = G(ax + by)\\).\nIntervals of Validity \u2013 In this section we will give an in depth look at intervals of validity as well as an answer to the existence and uniqueness question for first order differential equations.\nModeling with First Order Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we will use first order differential equations to model physical situations. In particular we will look at mixing problems (modeling the amount of a substance dissolved in a liquid and liquid both enters and exits), population problems (modeling a population under a variety of situations in which the population can enter or exit) and falling objects (modeling the velocity of a falling object under the influence of both gravity and air resistance).\nEquilibrium Solutions \u2013 In this section we will define equilibrium solutions (or equilibrium points) for autonomous differential equations, \\(y' = f(y)\\). We discuss classifying equilibrium solutions as asymptotically stable, unstable or semi-stable equilibrium solutions.\nEuler\u2019s Method \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll take a brief look at a fairly simple method for approximating solutions to differential equations. We derive the formulas used by Euler\u2019s Method and give a brief discussion of the errors in the approximations of the solutions.\n\nSecond Order Differential Equations - In this chapter we will start looking at second order differential equations. We will concentrate mostly on constant coefficient second order differential equations. We will derive the solutions for homogeneous differential equations and we will use the methods of undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters to solve non homogeneous differential equations. In addition, we will discuss reduction of order, fundamentals of sets of solutions, Wronskian and mechanical vibrations.\nBasic Concepts \u2013 In this section give an in depth discussion on the process used to solve homogeneous, linear, second order differential equations, \\(ay'' + by' + cy = 0\\). We derive the characteristic polynomial and discuss how the Principle of Superposition is used to get the general solution.\nReal Roots \u2013 In this section we discuss the solution to homogeneous, linear, second order differential equations, \\(ay'' + by' + cy = 0\\), in which the roots of the characteristic polynomial, \\(ar^{2} + br + c = 0\\), are real distinct roots.\nComplex Roots \u2013 In this section we discuss the solution to homogeneous, linear, second order differential equations, \\(ay'' + by' + cy = 0\\), in which the roots of the characteristic polynomial, \\(ar^{2} + br + c = 0\\), are real distinct roots. We will also derive from the complex roots the standard solution that is typically used in this case that will not involve complex numbers.\nRepeated Roots \u2013 In this section we discuss the solution to homogeneous, linear, second order differential equations, \\(ay'' + by' + cy = 0\\), in which the roots of the characteristic polynomial, \\(ar^{2} + br + c = 0\\), are repeated, i.e. double, roots. We will use reduction of order to derive the second solution needed to get a general solution in this case.\nReduction of Order \u2013 In this section we will discuss reduction of order, the process used to derive the solution to the repeated roots case for homogeneous linear second order differential equations, in greater detail. This will be one of the few times in this chapter that non-constant coefficient differential equation will be looked at.\nFundamental Sets of Solutions \u2013 In this section we will a look at some of the theory behind the solution to second order differential equations. We define fundamental sets of solutions and discuss how they can be used to get a general solution to a homogeneous second order differential equation. We will also define the Wronskian and show how it can be used to determine if a pair of solutions are a fundamental set of solutions.\nMore on the Wronskian \u2013 In this section we will examine how the Wronskian, introduced in the previous section, can be used to determine if two functions are linearly independent or linearly dependent. We will also give and an alternate method for finding the Wronskian.\nNonhomogeneous Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we will discuss the basics of solving nonhomogeneous differential equations. We define the complimentary and particular solution and give the form of the general solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation.\nUndetermined Coefficients \u2013 In this section we introduce the method of undetermined coefficients to find particular solutions to nonhomogeneous differential equation. We work a wide variety of examples illustrating the many guidelines for making the initial guess of the form of the particular solution that is needed for the method.\nVariation of Parameters \u2013 In this section we introduce the method of variation of parameters to find particular solutions to nonhomogeneous differential equation. We give a detailed examination of the method as well as derive a formula that can be used to find particular solutions.\nMechanical Vibrations \u2013 In this section we will examine mechanical vibrations. In particular we will model an object connected to a spring and moving up and down. We also allow for the introduction of a damper to the system and for general external forces to act on the object. Note as well that while we example mechanical vibrations in this section a simple change of notation (and corresponding change in what the quantities represent) can move this into almost any other engineering field.\n\nLaplace Transforms - In this chapter we introduce Laplace Transforms and how they are used to solve Initial Value Problems. With the introduction of Laplace Transforms we will now be able to solve some Initial Value Problems that we wouldn\u2019t be able to solve otherwise. We will solve differential equations that involve Heaviside and Dirac Delta functions. We will also give brief overview on using Laplace transforms to solve nonconstant coefficient differential equations. In addition, we will define the convolution integral and show how it can be used to take inverse transforms.\nThe Definition \u2013 In this section we give the definition of the Laplace transform. We will also compute a couple Laplace transforms using the definition.\nLaplace Transforms \u2013 In this section we introduce the way we usually compute Laplace transforms that avoids needing to use the definition. We discuss the table of Laplace transforms used in this material and work a variety of examples illustrating the use of the table of Laplace transforms.\nInverse Laplace Transforms \u2013 In this section we ask the opposite question from the previous section. In other words, given a Laplace transform, what function did we originally have? We again work a variety of examples illustrating how to use the table of Laplace transforms to do this as well as some of the manipulation of the given Laplace transform that is needed in order to use the table.\nStep Functions \u2013 In this section we introduce the step or Heaviside function. We illustrate how to write a piecewise function in terms of Heaviside functions. We also work a variety of examples showing how to take Laplace transforms and inverse Laplace transforms that involve Heaviside functions. We also derive the formulas for taking the Laplace transform of functions which involve Heaviside functions.\nSolving IVPs' with Laplace Transforms - In this section we will examine how to use Laplace transforms to solve IVP\u2019s. The examples in this section are restricted to differential equations that could be solved without using Laplace transform. The advantage of starting out with this type of differential equation is that the work tends to be not as involved and we can always check our answers if we wish to.\nNonconstant Coefficient IVP\u2019s \u2013 In this section we will give a brief overview of using Laplace transforms to solve some nonconstant coefficient IVP\u2019s. We do not work a great many examples in this section. We only work a couple to illustrate how the process works with Laplace transforms.\nIVP\u2019s with Step Functions \u2013 This is the section where the reason for using Laplace transforms really becomes apparent. We will use Laplace transforms to solve IVP\u2019s that contain Heaviside (or step) functions. Without Laplace transforms solving these would involve quite a bit of work. While we do work one of these examples without Laplace transforms, we do it only to show what would be involved if we did try to solve one of the examples without using Laplace transforms.\nDirac Delta Function \u2013 In this section we introduce the Dirac Delta function and derive the Laplace transform of the Dirac Delta function. We work a couple of examples of solving differential equations involving Dirac Delta functions and unlike problems with Heaviside functions our only real option for this kind of differential equation is to use Laplace transforms. We also give a nice relationship between Heaviside and Dirac Delta functions.\nConvolution Integral \u2013 In this section we give a brief introduction to the convolution integral and how it can be used to take inverse Laplace transforms. We also illustrate its use in solving a differential equation in which the forcing function (i.e. the term without any y\u2019s in it) is not known.\nTable of Laplace Transforms \u2013 This section is the table of Laplace Transforms that we\u2019ll be using in the material. We give as wide a variety of Laplace transforms as possible including some that aren\u2019t often given in tables of Laplace transforms.\n\nSystems of Differential Equations - In this chapter we will look at solving systems of differential equations. We will restrict ourselves to systems of two linear differential equations for the purposes of the discussion but many of the techniques will extend to larger systems of linear differential equations. We also examine sketch phase planes/portraits for systems of two differential equations. In addition, we give brief discussions on using Laplace transforms to solve systems and some modeling that gives rise to systems of differential equations.\nReview : Systems of Equations \u2013 In this section we will give a review of the traditional starting point for a linear algebra class. We will use linear algebra techniques to solve a system of equations as well as give a couple of useful facts about the number of solutions that a system of equations can have.\nReview : Matrices and Vectors \u2013 In this section we will give a brief review of matrices and vectors. We will look at arithmetic involving matrices and vectors, finding the inverse of a matrix, computing the determinant of a matrix, linearly dependent/independent vectors and converting systems of equations into matrix form.\nReview : Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors \u2013 In this section we will introduce the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. We define the characteristic polynomial and show how it can be used to find the eigenvalues for a matrix. Once we have the eigenvalues for a matrix we also show how to find the corresponding eigenvalues for the matrix.\nSystems of Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we will look at some of the basics of systems of differential equations. We show how to convert a system of differential equations into matrix form. In addition, we show how to convert an \\(n^{ \\text{th}}\\) order differential equation into a system of differential equations.\nSolutions to Systems \u2013 In this section we will a quick overview on how we solve systems of differential equations that are in matrix form. We also define the Wronskian for systems of differential equations and show how it can be used to determine if we have a general solution to the system of differential equations.\nPhase Plane \u2013 In this section we will give a brief introduction to the phase plane and phase portraits. We define the equilibrium solution/point for a homogeneous system of differential equations and how phase portraits can be used to determine the stability of the equilibrium solution. We also show the formal method of how phase portraits are constructed.\nReal Eigenvalues \u2013 In this section we will solve systems of two linear differential equations in which the eigenvalues are distinct real numbers. We will also show how to sketch phase portraits associated with real distinct eigenvalues (saddle points and nodes).\nComplex Eigenvalues \u2013 In this section we will solve systems of two linear differential equations in which the eigenvalues are complex numbers. This will include illustrating how to get a solution that does not involve complex numbers that we usually are after in these cases. We will also show how to sketch phase portraits associated with complex eigenvalues (centers and spirals).\nRepeated Eigenvalues \u2013 In this section we will solve systems of two linear differential equations in which the eigenvalues are real repeated (double in this case) numbers. This will include deriving a second linearly independent solution that we will need to form the general solution to the system. We will also show how to sketch phase portraits associated with real repeated eigenvalues (improper nodes).\nNonhomogeneous Systems \u2013 In this section we will work quick examples illustrating the use of undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters to solve nonhomogeneous systems of differential equations. The method of undetermined coefficients will work pretty much as it does for nth order differential equations, while variation of parameters will need some extra derivation work to get a formula/process we can use on systems.\nLaplace Transforms \u2013 In this section we will work a quick example illustrating how Laplace transforms can be used to solve a system of two linear differential equations.\nModeling \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll take a quick look at some extensions of some of the modeling we did in previous chapters that lead to systems of differential equations. In particular we will look at mixing problems in which we have two interconnected tanks of water, a predator-prey problem in which populations of both are taken into account and a mechanical vibration problem with two masses, connected with a spring and each connected to a wall with a spring.\n\nSeries Solutions to Differential Equations - In this chapter we are going to take a quick look at how to represent the solution to a differential equation with a power series. We will also look at how to solve Euler\u2019s differential equation. In addition, we will do a quick review of power series and Taylor series to help with work in the chapter.\nReview : Power Series \u2013 In this section we give a brief review of some of the basics of power series. Included are discussions of using the Ratio Test to determine if a power series will converge, adding/subtracting power series, differentiating power series and index shifts for power series.\nReview : Taylor Series \u2013 In this section we give a quick reminder on how to construct the Taylor series for a function. Included are derivations for the Taylor series of \\({\\bf e}^{x}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\) about \\(x = 0\\) as well as showing how to write down the Taylor series for a polynomial.\nSeries Solutions \u2013 In this section we define ordinary and singular points for a differential equation. We also show who to construct a series solution for a differential equation about an ordinary point. The method illustrated in this section is useful in solving, or at least getting an approximation of the solution, differential equations with coefficients that are not constant.\nEuler Equations \u2013 In this section we will discuss how to solve Euler\u2019s differential equation, \\(ax^{2}y'' + b x y' +c y = 0\\). Note that while this does not involve a series solution it is included in the series solution chapter because it illustrates how to get a solution to at least one type of differential equation at a singular point.\n\nHigher Order Differential Equations - In this chapter we will look at extending many of the ideas of the previous chapters to differential equations with order higher that 2nd order. In a few cases this will simply mean working an example to illustrate that the process doesn\u2019t really change, but in most cases there are some issues to discuss.\nBasic Concepts for \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) Order Linear Equations \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll start the chapter off with a quick look at some of the basic ideas behind solving higher order linear differential equations. Included will be updated definitions/facts for the Principle of Superposition, linearly independent functions and the Wronskian.\nLinear Homogeneous Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we will extend the ideas behind solving 2nd order, linear, homogeneous differential equations to higher order. As we\u2019ll most of the process is identical with a few natural extensions to repeated real roots that occur more than twice. We will also need to discuss how to deal with repeated complex roots, which are now a possibility. In addition, we will see that the main difficulty in the higher order cases is simply finding all the roots of the characteristic polynomial.\nUndetermined Coefficients \u2013 In this section we work a quick example to illustrate that using undetermined coefficients on higher order differential equations is no different that when we used it on 2nd order differential equations with only one small natural extension.\nVariation of Parameters \u2013 In this section we will give a detailed discussion of the process for using variation of parameters for higher order differential equations. We will also develop a formula that can be used in these cases. We will also see that the work involved in using variation of parameters on higher order differential equations can be quite involved on occasion.\nLaplace Transforms \u2013 In this section we will work a quick example using Laplace transforms to solve a differential equation on a 3rd order differential equation just to say that we looked at one with order higher than 2nd. As we\u2019ll see, outside of needing a formula for the Laplace transform of \\(y'''\\), which we can get from the general formula, there is no real difference in how Laplace transforms are used for higher order differential equations.\nSystems of Differential Equations \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll take a quick look at extending the ideas we discussed for solving \\(2 \\times 2\\) systems of differential equations to systems of size \\(3 \\times 3\\). As we will see they are mostly just natural extensions of what we already know how to do. We will also make a couple of quick comments about \\(4 \\times 4\\) systems.\nSeries Solutions \u2013 In this section we are going to work a quick example illustrating that the process of finding series solutions for higher order differential equations is pretty much the same as that used on 2nd order differential equations.\n\nBoundary Value Problems & Fourier Series - In this chapter we will introduce two topics that are integral to basic partial differential equations solution methods. The first topic, boundary value problems, occur in pretty much every partial differential equation. The second topic, Fourier series, is what makes one of the basic solution techniques work.\nBoundary Value Problems \u2013 In this section we\u2019ll define boundary conditions (as opposed to initial conditions which we should already be familiar with at this point) and the boundary value problem. We will also work a few examples illustrating some of the interesting differences in using boundary values instead of initial conditions in solving differential equations.\nEigenvalues and Eigenfunctions \u2013 In this section we will define eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for boundary value problems. We will work quite a few examples illustrating how to find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In one example the best we will be able to do is estimate the eigenvalues as that is something that will happen on a fairly regular basis with these kinds of problems.\nPeriodic Functions and Orthogonal Functions \u2013 In this section we will define periodic functions, orthogonal functions and mutually orthogonal functions. We will also work a couple of examples showing intervals on which \\(\\cos\\left(\\frac{n \\pi x}{L}\\right)\\) and \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{n \\pi x}{L}\\right)\\) are mutually orthogonal. The results of these examples will be very useful for the rest of this chapter and most of the next chapter.\nFourier Sine Series \u2013 In this section we define the Fourier Sine Series, i.e. representing a function with a series in the form \\(\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty {{B_n}\\sin \\left( {\\frac{{n\\pi x}}{L}} \\right)} \\). We will also define the odd extension for a function and work several examples finding the Fourier Sine Series for a function.\nFourier Cosine Series \u2013 In this section we define the Fourier Cosine Series, i.e. representing a function with a series in the form \\(\\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty {{A_n}\\cos \\left( {\\frac{{n\\pi x}}{L}} \\right)} \\). We will also define the even extension for a function and work several examples finding the Fourier Cosine Series for a function.\nFourier Series \u2013 In this section we define the Fourier Series, i.e. representing a function with a series in the form \\(\\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty {{A_n}\\cos \\left( {\\frac{{n\\pi x}}{L}} \\right)} + \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty {{B_n}\\sin \\left( {\\frac{{n\\pi x}}{L}} \\right)} \\). We will also work several examples finding the Fourier Series for a function.\nConvergence of Fourier Series \u2013 In this section we will define piecewise smooth functions and the periodic extension of a function. In addition, we will give a variety of facts about just what a Fourier series will converge to and when we can expect the derivative or integral of a Fourier series to converge to the derivative or integral of the function it represents.\n\nPartial Differential Equations - In this chapter we introduce Separation of Variables one of the basic solution techniques for solving partial differential equations. Included are partial derivations for the Heat Equation and Wave Equation. In addition, we give solutions to examples for the heat equation, the wave equation and Laplace\u2019s equation.\nThe Heat Equation \u2013 In this section we will do a partial derivation of the heat equation that can be solved to give the temperature in a one dimensional bar of length L. In addition, we give several possible boundary conditions that can be used in this situation. We also define the Laplacian in this section and give a version of the heat equation for two or three dimensional situations.\nThe Wave Equation \u2013 In this section we do a partial derivation of the wave equation which can be used to find the one dimensional displacement of a vibrating string. In addition, we also give the two and three dimensional version of the wave equation.\nTerminology \u2013 In this section we take a quick look at some of the terminology we will be using in the rest of this chapter. In particular we will define a linear operator, a linear partial differential equation and a homogeneous partial differential equation. We also give a quick reminder of the Principle of Superposition.\nSeparation of Variables \u2013 In this section show how the method of Separation of Variables can be applied to a partial differential equation to reduce the partial differential equation down to two ordinary differential equations. We apply the method to several partial differential equations. We do not, however, go any farther in the solution process for the partial differential equations. That will be done in later sections. The point of this section is only to illustrate how the method works.\nSolving the Heat Equation \u2013 In this section we go through the complete separation of variables process, including solving the two ordinary differential equations the process generates. We will do this by solving the heat equation with three different sets of boundary conditions. Included is an example solving the heat equation on a bar of length \\(L\\) but instead on a thin circular ring.\nHeat Equation with Non-Zero Temperature Boundaries \u2013 In this section we take a quick look at solving the heat equation in which the boundary conditions are fixed, non-zero temperature. Note that this is in contrast to the previous section when we generally required the boundary conditions to be both fixed and zero.\nLaplace\u2019s Equation \u2013 In this section we discuss solving Laplace\u2019s equation. As we will see this is exactly the equation we would need to solve if we were looking to find the equilibrium solution (i.e. time independent) for the two dimensional heat equation with no sources. We will also convert Laplace\u2019s equation to polar coordinates and solve it on a disk of radius \\(a\\).\nVibrating String \u2013 In this section we solve the one dimensional wave equation to get the displacement of a vibrating string.\nSummary of Separation of Variables \u2013 In this final section we give a quick summary of the method of separation of variables for solving partial differential equations.\n\n\n[Contact Me]\u00a0[Privacy Statement]\u00a0[Site Help & FAQ]\u00a0[Terms of Use]\n\u00a9 2003 - 2025 Paul Dawkins\nPage Last Modified : 6/26/2023\n\nSkip to main content\nchrome_reader_mode\nEnter Reader Mode\nSearch \n Search\nSign in\n Expand/collapse global hierarchy\n Home   Campus Bookshelves   Community College of Denver   MAT 2562 Differential Equations with Linear Algebra   9: Linear Higher Order Differential Equations\n Expand/collapse global location\n9: Linear Higher Order Differential Equations\n8.4: A Brief Table of Laplace Transforms\n \n9.1: Introduction to Linear Higher Order Equations\nWilliam F.

In particular, if a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of v0 ft/s, then an initial-value problem that describes the velocity of the ball after t seconds is given by\n\ndv\n\n\ndt\n=\u221232,v(0)=v0.\n\nThis model assumes that the only force acting on the ball is gravity. Now we add to the problem by allowing for the possibility of air resistance acting on the ball.\n\nAir resistance always acts in the direction opposite to motion. Therefore if an object is rising, air resistance acts in a downward direction. If the object is falling, air resistance acts in an upward direction (Figure 4.24). There is no exact relationship between the velocity of an object and the air resistance acting on it. For very small objects, air resistance is proportional to velocity; that is, the force due to air resistance is numerically equal to some constant k times v. For larger (e.g., baseball-sized) objects, depending on the shape, air resistance can be approximately proportional to the square of the velocity. In fact, air resistance may be proportional to v1.5, or v0.9, or some other power of v.\n\nFigure 4.24 Forces acting on a moving baseball: gravity acts in a downward direction and air resistance acts in a direction opposite to the direction of motion.\n\nWe will work with the linear approximation for air resistance. If we assume k>0, then the expression for the force FA due to air resistance is given by FA=\u2212kv. Therefore the sum of the forces acting on the object is equal to the sum of the gravitational force and the force due to air resistance. This, in turn, is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration at time t (Newton\u2019s second law). This gives us the differential equation\n\nm\ndv\n\n\ndt\n=\u2212kv\u2212mg.\n\nFinally, we impose an initial condition v(0)=v0, where v0 is the initial velocity measured in meters per second. This makes g=9.8m/s2. The initial-value problem becomes\n\nm\ndv\n\n\ndt\n=\u2212kv\u2212mg,v(0)=v0.\n(4.13)\n\nThe differential equation in this initial-value problem is an example of a first-order linear differential equation. (Recall that a differential equation is first-order if the highest-order derivative that appears in the equation is 1.) In this section, we study first-order linear equations and examine a method for finding a general solution to these types of equations, as well as solving initial-value problems involving them.\n\nDEFINITION\n\nA first-order differential equation is linear if it can be written in the form\n\na(x)y\u2032+b(x)y=c(x),\n(4.14)\n\nwhere a(x),b(x), and c(x) are arbitrary functions of x.\n\nRemember that the unknown function y depends on the variable x; that is, x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. Some examples of first-order linear differential equations are\n\n(3x2\u22124)y\u2032+(x\u22123)y\t=\tsinx\n(sinx)y\u2032\u2212(cosx)y\t=\tcotx\n4xy\u2032+(3lnx)y\t=\tx3\u22124x.\n\nExamples of first-order nonlinear differential equations include\n\n(y\u2032)4\u2212(y\u2032)3\t=\t(3x\u22122)(y+4)\n4y\u2032+3y3\t=\t4x\u22125\n(y\u2032)2\t=\tsiny+cosx.\n\nThese equations are nonlinear because of terms like (y\u2032)4,y3, etc. Due to these terms, it is impossible to put these equations into the same form as Equation 4.14.\n\nStandard Form\n\nConsider the differential equation\n\n(3x2\u22124)y\u2032+(x\u22123)y=sinx.\n\nOur main goal in this section is to derive a solution method for equations of this form. It is useful to have the coefficient of y\u2032 be equal to 1. To make this happen, we divide both sides by 3x2\u22124.\n\ny\u2032+(\nx\u22123\n\n\n3x2\u22124\n)y=\nsinx\n\n\n3x2\u22124\n\nThis is called the standard form of the differential equation. We will use it later when finding the solution to a general first-order linear differential equation. Returning to Equation 4.14, we can divide both sides of the equation by a(x). This leads to the equation\n\ny\u2032+\nb(x)\n\n\na(x)\ny=\nc(x)\n\n\na(x)\n.\n(4.15)\n\nNow define p(x)=\nb(x)\n\n\na(x)\n and q(x)=\nc(x)\n\n\na(x)\n. Then Equation 4.14 becomes\n\ny\u2032+p(x)y=q(x).\n(4.16)\n\nWe can write any first-order linear differential equation in this form, and this is referred to as the standard form for a first-order linear differential equation.\n\nEXAMPLE 4.15\nWriting First-Order Linear Equations in Standard Form\n\nPut each of the following first-order linear differential equations into standard form. Identify p(x) and q(x) for each equation.\n\ny\u2032=3x\u22124y\n3xy\u2032\n\n\n4y\u22123\n=2 (here x\u22600)\ny=3y\u2032\u22124x2+5\nCHECKPOINT 4.15\n\nPut the equation \n(x+3)y\u2032\n\n\n2x\u22123y\u22124\n=5 into standard form and identify p(x) and q(x).\n\nIntegrating Factors\n\nWe now develop a solution technique for any first-order linear differential equation. We start with the standard form of a first-order linear differential equation:\n\ny\u2032+p(x)y=q(x).\n(4.18)\n\nThe first term on the left-hand side of Equation 4.15 is the derivative of the unknown function, and the second term is the product of a known function with the unknown function. This is somewhat reminiscent of the product rule from the Differentiation Rules section. If we multiply Equation 4.16 by a yet-to-be-determined function \u03bc(x), then the equation becomes\n\n\u03bc(x)y\u2032+\u03bc(x)p(x)y=\u03bc(x)q(x).\n(4.19)\n\nThe left-hand side Equation 4.18 can be matched perfectly to the product rule:\n\nd\n\n\ndx\n[f(x)g(x)]=f\u2032(x)g(x)+f(x)g\u2032(x).\n\nMatching term by term gives y=f(x),g(x)=\u03bc(x), and g\u2032(x)=\u03bc(x)p(x). Taking the derivative of g(x)=\u03bc(x) and setting it equal to the right-hand side of g\u2032(x)=\u03bc(x)p(x) leads to\n\n\u03bc\u2032(x)=\u03bc(x)p(x).\n\nThis is a first-order, separable differential equation for \u03bc(x). We know p(x) because it appears in the differential equation we are solving.

This leads to a general method for solving a first-order linear differential equation. We first multiply both sides of Equation 4.16 by the integrating factor \u03bc(x).

An important note about the integrating constant C: It may seem that we are inconsistent in the usage of the integrating constant. However, the integral involving p(x) is necessary in order to find an integrating factor for Equation 4.15. Only one integrating factor is needed in order to solve the equation; therefore, it is safe to assign a value for C for this integral. We chose C=0. When calculating the integral inside the brackets in Equation 4.21, it is necessary to keep our options open for the value of the integrating constant, because our goal is to find a general family of solutions to Equation 4.15. This integrating factor guarantees just that.\n\nPROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY\nSolving a First-order Linear Differential Equation\nPut the equation into standard form and identify p(x) and q(x).\nCalculate the integrating factor \u03bc(x)=e\u222bp(x)dx.\nMultiply both sides of the differential equation by \u03bc(x).\nIntegrate both sides of the equation obtained in step 3, and divide both sides by \u03bc(x).\nIf there is an initial condition, determine the value of C.\nEXAMPLE 4.16\nSolving a First-order Linear Equation\n\nFind a general solution for the differential equation xy\u2032+3y=4x2\u22123x. Assume x>0.\n\nAnalysis\n\nYou may have noticed the condition that was imposed on the differential equation; namely, x>0. For any nonzero value of C, the general solution is not defined at x=0. Furthermore, when x<0, the integrating factor changes. The integrating factor is given by Equation 4.19 as f(x)=e\u222bp(x)dx. For this p(x) we get\n\ne\u222bp(x)dx=e\u222b(3/x)dx=e3ln|x|=|x|3,\n\nsince x<0. The behavior of the general solution changes at x=0 largely due to the fact that p(x) is not defined there.\n\nCHECKPOINT 4.16\n\nFind the general solution to the differential equation (x\u22122)y\u2032+y=3x2+2x.

The first involves air resistance as it relates to objects that are rising or falling; the second involves an electrical circuit. Other applications are numerous, but most are solved in a similar fashion.\n\nFree fall with air resistance\n\nWe discussed air resistance at the beginning of this section. The next example shows how to apply this concept for a ball in vertical motion. Other factors can affect the force of air resistance, such as the size and shape of the object, but we ignore them here.\n\nEXAMPLE 4.18\nA Ball with Air Resistance\n\nA racquetball is hit straight upward with an initial velocity of 2 m/s. The mass of a racquetball is approximately 0.0427 kg. Air resistance acts on the ball with a force numerically equal to 0.5v, where v represents the velocity of the ball at time t.\n\nFind the velocity of the ball as a function of time.\nHow long does it take for the ball to reach its maximum height?\nIf the ball is hit from an initial height of 1 meter, how high will it reach?\nCHECKPOINT 4.18\n\nThe weight of a penny is 2.5 grams (United States Mint, \u201cCoin Specifications,\u201d accessed April 9, 2015, http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications), and the upper observation deck of the Empire State Building is 369 meters above the street. Since the penny is a small and relatively smooth object, air resistance acting on the penny is actually quite small. We assume the air resistance is numerically equal to 0.0025v. Furthermore, the penny is dropped with no initial velocity imparted to it.\n\nSet up an initial-value problem that represents the falling penny.\nSolve the problem for v(t).\nWhat is the terminal velocity of the penny (i.e., calculate the limit of the velocity as t approaches infinity)?\nElectrical Circuits\n\nA source of electromotive force (e.g., a battery or generator) produces a flow of current in a closed circuit, and this current produces a voltage drop across each resistor, inductor, and capacitor in the circuit. Kirchhoff\u2019s Loop Rule states that the sum of the voltage drops across resistors, inductors, and capacitors is equal to the total electromotive force in a closed circuit. We have the following three results:\n\nThe voltage drop across a resistor is given by\n\nER=Ri,\n\nwhere R is a constant of proportionality called the resistance, and i is the current.\nThe voltage drop across an inductor is given by\n\nEL=Li\u2032,\n\nwhere L is a constant of proportionality called the inductance, and i again denotes the current.\nThe voltage drop across a capacitor is given by\n\nEC=\n1\n\n\nC\nq,\n\nwhere C is a constant of proportionality called the capacitance, and q is the instantaneous charge on the capacitor. The relationship between i and q is i=q\u2032.\n\nWe use units of volts (V) to measure voltage E, amperes (A) to measure current i, coulombs (C) to measure charge q, ohms (\u03a9) to measure resistance R, henrys (H) to measure inductance L, and farads (F) to measure capacitance C. Consider the circuit in Figure 4.25.\n\nFigure 4.25 A typical electric circuit, containing a voltage generator (VS), capacitor (C), inductor (L), and resistor (R).\n\nApplying Kirchhoff\u2019s Loop Rule to this circuit, we let E denote the electromotive force supplied by the voltage generator. Then\n\nEL+ER+EC=E.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for EL,ER, and EC into this equation, we obtain\n\nLi\u2032+Ri+\n1\n\n\nC\nq=E.\n(4.24)\n\nIf there is no capacitor in the circuit, then the equation becomes\n\nLi\u2032+Ri=E.\n(4.25)\n\nThis is a first-order differential equation in i. The circuit is referred to as an LR circuit.\n\nNext, suppose there is no inductor in the circuit, but there is a capacitor and a resistor, so L=0,R\u22600, and C\u22600. Then Equation 4.23 can be rewritten as\n\nRq\u2032+\n1\n\n\nC\nq=E,\n(4.26)\n\nwhich is a first-order linear differential equation. This is referred to as an RC circuit. In either case, we can set up and solve an initial-value problem.\n\nEXAMPLE 4.19\nFinding Current in an RL Electric Circuit\n\nA circuit has in series an electromotive force given by E=50sin20tV, a resistor of 5\u03a9, and an inductor of 0.4H. If the initial current is 0, find the current at time t>0.\n\nCHECKPOINT 4.19\n\nA circuit has in series an electromotive force given by E=20sin5t V, a capacitor with capacitance 0.02F, and a resistor of 8\u03a9. If the initial charge is 4C, find the charge at time t>0.\n\nSection 4.5 Exercises\n\nAre the following differential equations linear?

Equations appearing in applications tend to be second order. Higher order equations do appear from time to time, but generally the world around us is \u201csecond order.\u201d\nThe basic results about linear ODEs of higher order are essentially the same as for second order equations, with 2 replaced by \\(n\\text{.}\\) The important concept of linear independence is somewhat more complicated when more than two functions are involved. For higher order constant coefficient ODEs, the methods developed are also somewhat harder to apply, but we will not dwell on these complications. It is also possible to use the methods for systems of linear equations from Chapter\u00a07 to solve higher order constant coefficient equations.\nLet us start with a general homogeneous linear equation\n\\begin{equation} y^{(n)} + p_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \\cdots + p_1(x) y' + p_0(x) y = 0 .\\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\n2.3.1 Linear independence\nVideo 2.3.1. Linear Independence. \nWhen we had two functions \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) we said they were linearly independent if one was not the multiple of the other. Same idea holds for \\(n\\) functions. In this case it is easier to state as follows. The functions \\(y_1\\text{,}\\) \\(y_2\\text{,}\\) ..., \\(y_n\\) are linearly independent if the equation\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 + \\cdots + c_n y_n = 0 \\end{equation*}\nhas only the trivial solution \\(c_1 = c_2 = \\cdots = c_n = 0\\text{,}\\) where the equation must hold for all \\(x\\text{.}\\) If we can solve equation with some constants where for example \\(c_1 \\not= 0\\text{,}\\) then we can solve for \\(y_1\\) as a linear combination of the others. If the functions are not linearly independent, they are linearly dependent.\nThere are several ways to show that a set of functions are linearly independent. The first method we\u2019ll present uses a tool called the Wronskian, which is rather unintuitive but computationally simple.\n\\begin{equation} W(y_1,...y_n)= \\begin{vmatrix} y_1 & y_2 & ... & y_n \\\\ y_1' & y_2' & ... & y_n' \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ y_1^{(n-1)} & y_2^{(n-1)} & ... & y_n^{(n-1) } \\end{vmatrix} .\\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\nIf the functions \\(y_1,...,y_n\\) where linearly dependent (and \\(n-1\\) times differentiable), then the columns of the matrix in the Wronskian will be as well and thus the Wronskian is zero. Thus to show a set of functions is linearly independent on an interval \\(I\\) it suffices to find a single point in \\(I\\) where the Wronskian is non-zero. Note the converse is not true, \\(W=0\\) does not imply linear dependence.\nExample 2.3.1.  \\(e^x\\) and \\(e^{2x}\\) are linearly independent as\n\\begin{equation*} W(e^x, e^{2x})=\\begin{vmatrix}e^x & e^{2x}\\\\ e^x & 2e^{2x}\\end{vmatrix}=e^{3x}. \\end{equation*}\nAs \\(e^{3x}\\neq 0\\) for any \\(x\\text{,}\\) these two functions are linearly independent everywhere.\nExample 2.3.2.  Show that \\(e^x, e^{2x}, e^{3x}\\) are linearly independent.\nLet us write down\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x} + c_3 e^{3x} = 0. \\end{equation*}\nWe use rules of exponentials and write \\(z = e^x\\text{.}\\) Hence \\(z^2 = e^{2x}\\) and \\(z^3 = e^{3x}\\text{.}\\) Then we have\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 z + c_2 z^2 + c_3 z^3 = 0. \\end{equation*}\nThe left-hand side is a third degree polynomial in \\(z\\text{.}\\) It is either identically zero, or it has at most 3 zeros. Therefore, it is identically zero, \\(c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0\\text{,}\\) and the functions are linearly independent.\nLet us try another way. As before we write\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x} + c_3 e^{3x} = 0. \\end{equation*}\nThis equation has to hold for all \\(x\\text{.}\\) We divide through by \\(e^{3x}\\) to get\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 e^{-2x} + c_2 e^{-x} + c_3 = 0. \\end{equation*}\nAs the equation is true for all \\(x\\text{,}\\) let \\(x \\to \\infty\\text{.}\\) After taking the limit we see that \\(c_3 = 0\\text{.}\\) Hence our equation becomes\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x} = 0. \\end{equation*}\nRinse, repeat!\nHow about yet another way. We again write\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x} + c_3 e^{3x} = 0. \\end{equation*}\nWe can evaluate the equation and its derivatives at different values of \\(x\\) to obtain equations for \\(c_1\\text{,}\\) \\(c_2\\text{,}\\) and \\(c_3\\text{.}\\) Let us first divide by \\(e^{x}\\) for simplicity.\n\\begin{equation*} c_1 + c_2 e^{x} + c_3 e^{2x} = 0. \\end{equation*}\nWe set \\(x=0\\) to get the equation \\(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0\\text{.}\\) Now differentiate both sides\n\\begin{equation*} c_2 e^{x} + 2 c_3 e^{2x} = 0 . \\end{equation*}\nWe set \\(x=0\\) to get \\(c_2 + 2c_3 = 0\\text{.}\\) We divide by \\(e^x\\) again and differentiate to get \\(2 c_3 e^{x} = 0\\text{.}\\) It is clear that \\(c_3\\) is zero. Then \\(c_2\\) must be zero as \\(c_2 = -2c_3\\text{,}\\) and \\(c_1\\) must be zero because \\(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0\\text{.}\\)\nThere is no one best way to do it. All of these methods are perfectly valid. The important thing is to understand why the functions are linearly independent.\nExample 2.3.3.  On the other hand, the functions \\(e^x\\text{,}\\) \\(e^{-x}\\text{,}\\) and \\(\\cosh x\\) are linearly dependent. Simply apply definition of the hyperbolic cosine:\n\\begin{equation*} \\cosh x = \\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad 2 \\cosh x - e^x - e^{-x} = 0. \\end{equation*}\n2.3.2 Theory of Higher Order ODEs\nVideo 2.3.2. Theory of Higher Order ODEs. \nTheorem 2.3.1. Superposition.  Suppose \\(y_1\\text{,}\\) \\(y_2\\text{,}\\) ..., \\(y_n\\) are solutions of the homogeneous equation (2.4). Then\n\\begin{equation*} y(x) = C_1 y_1(x) + C_2 y_2(x) + \\cdots + C_n y_n(x) \\end{equation*}\nalso solves (2.4) for arbitrary constants \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n\\text{.}\\)\nIn other words, a linear combination of solutions to (2.4) is also a solution to (2.4). We also have the existence and uniqueness theorem for nonhomogeneous linear equations.\nTheorem 2.3.2. Existence and uniqueness.  Suppose \\(p_0\\) through \\(p_{n-1}\\text{,}\\) and \\(f\\) are continuous functions on some interval \\(I\\text{,}\\) \\(a\\) is a number in \\(I\\text{,}\\) and \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_{n-1}\\) are constants. The equation\n\\begin{equation*} y^{(n)} + p_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \\cdots + p_1(x) y' + p_0(x) y = f(x) \\end{equation*}\nhas exactly one solution \\(y(x)\\) defined on the same interval \\(I\\) satisfying the initial conditions\n\\begin{equation*} y(a) = b_0, \\quad y'(a) = b_1, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad y^{(n-1)}(a) = b_{n-1} . \\end{equation*}\n2.3.3 Constant coefficient higher order ODEs\nVideo 2.3.3. Higher Order Constant Coefficient ODEs. \nWhen we have a higher order constant coefficient homogeneous linear equation, the song and dance is exactly the same as it was for second order. We just need to find more solutions. If the equation is \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) order, we need to find \\(n\\) linearly independent solutions. It is best seen by example.\nExample 2.3.4.  Find the general solution to\n\\begin{equation} y''' - 3 y'' - y' + 3y = 0 .\\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\nTry: \\(y = e^{rx}\\text{.}\\) We plug in and get\n\\begin{equation*} \\underbrace{r^3 e^{rx}}_{y'''} - 3 \\underbrace{r^2 e^{rx}}_{y''} - \\underbrace{r e^{rx}}_{y'} + 3 \\underbrace{e^{rx}}_{y} = 0 . \\end{equation*}\nWe divide through by \\(e^{rx}\\text{.}\\) Then\n\\begin{equation*} r^3 - 3 r^2 - r + 3 = 0 . \\end{equation*}\nThe trick now is to find the roots. There is a formula for the roots of degree 3 and 4 polynomials but it is very complicated. There is no formula for higher degree polynomials. That does not mean that the roots do not exist. There are always \\(n\\) roots for an \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) degree polynomial. They may be repeated and they may be complex. Computers are pretty good at finding roots approximately for reasonable size polynomials.\nA good place to start is to plot the polynomial and check where it is zero. We can also simply try plugging in. We just start plugging in numbers \\(r=-2,-1,0,1,2,\\ldots\\) and see if we get a hit (we can also try complex numbers). Even if we do not get a hit, we may get an indication of where the root is. For example, we plug \\(r=-2\\) into our polynomial and get \\(-15\\text{;}\\) we plug in \\(r=0\\) and get 3. That means there is a root between \\(r=-2\\) and \\(r=0\\text{,}\\) because the sign changed. If we find one root, say \\(r_1\\text{,}\\) then we know \\((r-r_1)\\) is a factor of our polynomial. Polynomial long division can then be used.\nA good strategy is to begin with \\(r=0\\text{,}\\) \\(1\\text{,}\\) or \\(-1\\text{.}\\) These are easy to compute. Our polynomial has two such roots, \\(r_1 = -1\\) and \\(r_2 = 1\\text{.}\\) There should be 3 roots and the last root is reasonably easy to find. The constant term in a monic\u20091\u2009 polynomial such as this is the multiple of the negations of all the roots because \\(r^3 - 3 r^2 - r + 3 = (r-r_1)(r-r_2)(r-r_3)\\text{.}\\) So\n\\begin{equation*} 3 = (-r_1)(-r_2)(-r_3) = (1)(-1)(-r_3) = r_3 . \\end{equation*}\nYou should check that \\(r_3 = 3\\) really is a root. Hence \\(e^{-x}\\text{,}\\) \\(e^{x}\\) and \\(e^{3x}\\) are solutions to (2.6). They are linearly independent as can easily be checked, and there are 3 of them, which happens to be exactly the number we need. So the general solution is\n\\begin{equation*} y = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 e^{x} + C_3 e^{3x} . \\end{equation*}\nSuppose we were given some initial conditions \\(y(0) = 1\\text{,}\\) \\(y'(0) = 2\\text{,}\\) and \\(y''(0) = 3\\text{.}\\) Then\n\\begin{equation*} \\begin{aligned} 1 = y(0) & = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 , \\\\ 2 = y'(0) & = -C_1 + C_2 + 3C_3 , \\\\ 3 = y''(0) & = C_1 + C_2 + 9C_3 . \\end{aligned} \\end{equation*}\nIt is possible to find the solution by high school algebra, but it would be a pain. The sensible way to solve a system of equations such as this is to use matrix algebra, see Section\u00a07.2 or Appendix\u00a0A. For now we note that the solution is \\(C_1 = -\\nicefrac{1}{4}\\text{,}\\) \\(C_2 = 1\\text{,}\\) and \\(C_3 = \\nicefrac{1}{4}\\text{.}\\) The specific solution to the ODE is\n\\begin{equation*} y = \\frac{-1}{4}\\, e^{-x} + e^x + \\frac{1}{4}\\, e^{3x} . \\end{equation*}\nNext, suppose that we have real roots, but they are repeated. Let us say we have a root \\(r\\) repeated \\(k\\) times. In the spirit of the second order solution, and for the same reasons, we have the solutions\n\\begin{equation*} e^{rx}, \\quad xe^{rx}, \\quad x^2 e^{rx}, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad x^{k-1} e^{rx} . \\end{equation*}\nWe take a linear combination of these solutions to find the general solution.\nExample 2.3.5.  Solve\n\\begin{equation*} y^{(4)} - 3 y''' + 3 y'' - y' = 0 . \\end{equation*}\nWe note that the characteristic equation is\n\\begin{equation*} r^4 - 3r^3 + 3r^2 -r = 0 . \\end{equation*}\nBy inspection we note that \\(r^4 - 3r^3 + 3r^2 -r = r{(r-1)}^3\\text{.}\\) Hence the roots given with multiplicity are \\(r = 0, 1, 1, 1\\text{.}\\) Thus the general solution is\n\\begin{equation*} y = \\underbrace{(C_1 + C_2 x + C_3 x^2)\\, e^x}_{\\text{terms coming from } r=1} + \\underbrace{C_4}_{\\text{from } r=0} . \\end{equation*}\nThe case of complex roots is similar to second order equations. Complex roots always come in pairs \\(r = \\alpha \\pm i \\beta\\text{.}\\) Suppose we have two such complex roots, each repeated \\(k\\) times. The corresponding solution is\n\\begin{equation*} ( C_0 + C_1 x + \\cdots + C_{k-1} x^{k-1} ) \\, e^{\\alpha x} \\cos (\\beta x) + ( D_0 + D_1 x + \\cdots + D_{k-1} x^{k-1} ) \\, e^{\\alpha x} \\sin (\\beta x) . \\end{equation*}\nwhere \\(C_0\\text{,}\\) ..., \\(C_{k-1}\\text{,}\\) \\(D_0\\text{,}\\) ..., \\(D_{k-1}\\) are arbitrary constants.\nExample 2.3.6.  Solve\n\\begin{equation*} y^{(4)} - 4 y''' + 8 y'' - 8 y' + 4y = 0 . \\end{equation*}\nThe characteristic equation is\n\\begin{equation*} \\begin{aligned} r^4 - 4 r^3 + 8 r^2 - 8 r + 4 & = 0 , \\\\ {(r^2-2r+2)}^2 & = 0 , \\\\ {\\bigl({(r-1)}^2+1\\bigr)}^2 & = 0 . \\end{aligned} \\end{equation*}\nHence the roots are \\(1 \\pm i\\text{,}\\) both with multiplicity 2. Hence the general solution to the ODE is\n\\begin{equation*} y = ( C_1 + C_2 x ) \\, e^{x} \\cos x + ( C_3 + C_4 x ) \\, e^{x} \\sin x . \\end{equation*}\nThe way we solved the characteristic equation above is really by guessing or by inspection. It is not so easy in general. We could also have asked a computer or an advanced calculator for the roots.\n2.3.4 Exercises\nExercise 2.3.1.

Section  Notes  Next Section \n\u00a0\nSection 2.1 : Linear Differential Equations\n\nThe first special case of first order differential equations that we will look at is the linear first order differential equation. In this case, unlike most of the first order cases that we will look at, we can actually derive a formula for the general solution. The general solution is derived below. However, we would suggest that you do not memorize the formula itself. Instead of memorizing the formula you should memorize and understand the process that I'm going to use to derive the formula. Most problems are actually easier to work by using the process instead of using the formula.\n\nSo, let's see how to solve a linear first order differential equation. Remember as we go through this process that the goal is to arrive at a solution that is in the form \\(y = y\\left( t \\right)\\). It's sometimes easy to lose sight of the goal as we go through this process for the first time.\n\nIn order to solve a linear first order differential equation we MUST start with the differential equation in the form shown below. If the differential equation is not in this form then the process we\u2019re going to use will not work.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\frac{{dy}}{{dt}} + p\\left( t \\right)y = g\\left( t \\right) \\label{eq:eq1} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nWhere both \\(p(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are continuous functions. Recall that a quick and dirty definition of a continuous function is that a function will be continuous provided you can draw the graph from left to right without ever picking up your pencil/pen. In other words, a function is continuous if there are no holes or breaks in it.\n\nNow, we are going to assume that there is some magical function somewhere out there in the world, \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\), called an integrating factor. Do not, at this point, worry about what this function is or where it came from. We will figure out what \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) is once we have the formula for the general solution in hand.\n\nSo, now that we have assumed the existence of \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) multiply everything in \\(\\eqref{eq:eq1}\\) by \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\). This will give.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\frac{{dy}}{{dt}} + \\mu \\left( t \\right)p\\left( t \\right)y = \\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right) \\label{eq:eq2} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nNow, this is where the magic of \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) comes into play. We are going to assume that whatever \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) is, it will satisfy the following.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mu \\left( t \\right)p\\left( t \\right) = \\mu '\\left( t \\right) \\label{eq:eq3} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nAgain do not worry about how we can find a \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) that will satisfy \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\). As we will see, provided \\(p(t)\\) is continuous we can find it. So substituting \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\) we now arrive at.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\frac{{dy}}{{dt}} + \\mu '\\left( t \\right)y = \\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right) \\label{eq:eq4} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nAt this point we need to recognize that the left side of \\(\\eqref{eq:eq4}\\) is nothing more than the following product rule.\n\n\\[\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\frac{{dy}}{{dt}} + \\mu '\\left( t \\right)y = {\\left( {\\mu \\left( t \\right)y\\left( t \\right)} \\right)^\\prime }\\]\n\nSo we can replace the left side of \\(\\eqref{eq:eq4}\\) with this product rule. Upon doing this \\(\\eqref{eq:eq4}\\) becomes\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}{\\left( {\\mu \\left( t \\right)y\\left( t \\right)} \\right)^\\prime } = \\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right) \\label{eq:eq5} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nNow, recall that we are after \\(y(t)\\). We can now do something about that. All we need to do is integrate both sides then use a little algebra and we'll have the solution. So, integrate both sides of \\(\\eqref{eq:eq5}\\) to get.\n\n\\[\\int{{{{\\left( {\\mu \\left( t \\right)y\\left( t \\right)} \\right)}^\\prime }\\,dt}} = \\int{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}\\] \\[\\begin{equation}\\mu \\left( t \\right)y\\left( t \\right) + c = \\int{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} \\label{eq:eq6} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nNote the constant of integration, \\(c\\), from the left side integration is included here. It is vitally important that this be included. If it is left out you will get the wrong answer every time.\n\nThe final step is then some algebra to solve for the solution, \\(y(t)\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\\mu \\left( t \\right)y\\left( t \\right) & = \\int{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} - c\\\\ y\\left( t \\right) & = \\frac{{\\int{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} - c}}{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)}}\\end{align*}\\]\n\nNow, from a notational standpoint we know that the constant of integration, \\(c\\), is an unknown constant and so to make our life easier we will absorb the minus sign in front of it into the constant and use a plus instead. This will NOT affect the final answer for the solution. So with this change we have.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}y\\left( t \\right) = \\frac{{\\int{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} + c}}{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)}} \\label{eq:eq7} \\end{equation}\\]\n\nAgain, changing the sign on the constant will not affect our answer. If you choose to keep the minus sign you will get the same value of \\(c\\) as we do except it will have the opposite sign. Upon plugging in \\(c\\) we will get exactly the same answer.\n\nThere is a lot of playing fast and loose with constants of integration in this section, so you will need to get used to it. When we do this we will always to try to make it very clear what is going on and try to justify why we did what we did.\n\nSo, now that we\u2019ve got a general solution to \\(\\eqref{eq:eq1}\\) we need to go back and determine just what this magical function \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) is. This is actually an easier process than you might think. We\u2019ll start with \\(\\eqref{eq:eq3}\\).\n\n\\[\\mu \\left( t \\right)p\\left( t \\right) = \\mu '\\left( t \\right)\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\),\n\n\\[\\frac{{\\mu '\\left( t \\right)}}{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)}} = p\\left( t \\right)\\]\n\nNow, hopefully you will recognize the left side of this from your Calculus I class as nothing more than the following derivative.\n\n\\[{\\left( {\\ln \\mu \\left( t \\right)} \\right)^\\prime } = p\\left( t \\right)\\]\n\nAs with the process above all we need to do is integrate both sides to get.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\\ln \\mu \\left( t \\right) + k &= \\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}\\\\ \\ln \\mu \\left( t \\right) & = \\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} + k\\end{align*}\\]\n\nYou will notice that the constant of integration from the left side, \\(k\\), had been moved to the right side and had the minus sign absorbed into it again as we did earlier. Also note that we\u2019re using \\(k\\) here because we\u2019ve already used \\(c\\) and in a little bit we\u2019ll have both of them in the same equation. So, to avoid confusion we used different letters to represent the fact that they will, in all probability, have different values.\n\nExponentiate both sides to get \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) out of the natural logarithm.\n\n\\[\\mu \\left( t \\right) = {{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}\\, + \\,k}}\\]\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to play fast and loose with constants again. It is inconvenient to have the \\(k\\) in the exponent so we\u2019re going to get it out of the exponent in the following way.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\\mu \\left( t \\right) & = {{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}\\, + \\,k}}\\\\ & = {{\\bf{e}}^k}{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}\\hspace{0.25in}\\hspace{0.25in}{\\mbox{Recall }}{x^{a + b}} = {x^a}{x^b}!\\end{align*}\\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s make use of the fact that \\(k\\) is an unknown constant. If \\(k\\) is an unknown constant then so is \\({{\\bf{e}}^k}\\) so we might as well just rename it \\(k\\) and make our life easier. This will give us the following.\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mu \\left( t \\right) = k\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}\\label{eq:eq8}\\end{equation}\\]\n\nSo, we now have a formula for the general solution, \\(\\eqref{eq:eq7}\\), and a formula for the integrating factor, \\(\\eqref{eq:eq8}\\). We do have a problem however. We\u2019ve got two unknown constants and the more unknown constants we have the more trouble we\u2019ll have later on. Therefore, it would be nice if we could find a way to eliminate one of them (we\u2019ll not be able to eliminate both\u2026.).\n\nThis is actually quite easy to do. First, substitute \\(\\eqref{eq:eq8}\\) into \\(\\eqref{eq:eq7}\\) and rearrange the constants.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}y\\left( t \\right) & = \\frac{{\\int{{k\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} + c}}{{k\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}}}\\\\ & = \\frac{{k\\int{{\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} + c}}{{k\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}}}\\\\ & = \\frac{{\\int{{\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} + \\frac{c}{k}}}{{\\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}}}\\end{align*}\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\eqref{eq:eq7}\\) can be written in such a way that the only place the two unknown constants show up is a ratio of the two. Then since both \\(c\\) and \\(k\\) are unknown constants so is the ratio of the two constants. Therefore we\u2019ll just call the ratio \\(c\\) and then drop \\(k\\) out of \\(\\eqref{eq:eq8}\\) since it will just get absorbed into \\(c\\) eventually.\n\nThe solution to a linear first order differential equation is then\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}y\\left( t \\right) = \\frac{{\\int{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)g\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}} + c}}{{\\mu \\left( t \\right)}}\\label{eq:eq9}\\end{equation}\\]\n\nwhere,\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\mu \\left( t \\right) = \\,{{\\bf{e}}^{\\int{{p\\left( t \\right)\\,dt}}}}\\label{eq:eq10}\\end{equation}\\]\n\nNow, the reality is that \\(\\eqref{eq:eq9}\\) is not as useful as it may seem. It is often easier to just run through the process that got us to \\(\\eqref{eq:eq9}\\) rather than using the formula. We will not use this formula in any of our examples. We will need to use \\(\\eqref{eq:eq10}\\) regularly, as that formula is easier to use than the process to derive it.\n\nSolution Process\n\nThe solution process for a first order linear differential equation is as follows.\n\nPut the differential equation in the correct initial form, \\(\\eqref{eq:eq1}\\).\n\n\nFind the integrating factor, \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\), using \\(\\eqref{eq:eq10}\\).\n\n\nMultiply everything in the differential equation by \\(\\mu \\left( t \\right)\\) and verify that the left side becomes the product rule \\(\\left( {\\mu \\left( t \\right)y\\left( t \\right)} \\right)'\\) and write it as such.\n\n\nIntegrate both sides, make sure you properly deal with the constant of integration.\nSolve for the solution \\(y(t)\\).\n\nLet\u2019s work a couple of examples. Let\u2019s start by solving the differential equation that we derived back in the Direction Field section.\n\nExample 1 Find the solution to the following differential equation. \\[\\frac{{dv}}{{dt}} = 9.8 - 0.196v\\]\nShow Solution \n\nFrom the solution to this example we can now see why the constant of integration is so important in this process. Without it, in this case, we would get a single, constant solution, \\(v(t)=50\\). With the constant of integration we get infinitely many solutions, one for each value of \\(c\\).\n\nBack in the direction field section where we first derived the differential equation used in the last example we used the direction field to help us sketch some solutions. Let's see if we got them correct. To sketch some solutions all we need to do is to pick different values of \\(c\\) to get a solution. Several of these are shown in the graph below.\n\nSo, it looks like we did pretty good sketching the graphs back in the direction field section.\n\nNow, recall from the Definitions section that the Initial Condition(s) will allow us to zero in on a particular solution. Solutions to first order differential equations (not just linear as we will see) will have a single unknown constant in them and so we will need exactly one initial condition to find the value of that constant and hence find the solution that we were after. The initial condition for first order differential equations will be of the form\n\n\\[y\\left( {{t_0}} \\right) = {y_0}\\]\n\nRecall as well that a differential equation along with a sufficient number of initial conditions is called an Initial Value Problem (IVP).\n\nExample 2 Solve the following IVP. \\[\\frac{{dv}}{{dt}} = 9.8 - 0.196v\\hspace{0.25in}v\\left( 0 \\right) = 48\\]\nShow Solution \n\nLet\u2019s do a couple of examples that are a little more involved.\n\nExample 3 Solve the following IVP. \\[\\cos \\left( x \\right)y' + \\sin \\left( x \\right)y = 2{\\cos ^3}\\left( x \\right)\\sin \\left( x \\right) - 1\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( {\\frac{\\pi }{4}} \\right) = 3\\sqrt 2 ,\\hspace{0.25in}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,0 \\le x < \\frac{\\pi }{2}\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 4 Find the solution to the following IVP.\n\n\\[t\\,y' + 2y = {t^2} - t + 1\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\nShow Solution \nExample 5 Find the solution to the following IVP.\n\n\\[t\\,y' - 2y = {t^5}\\sin \\left( {2t} \\right) - {t^3} + 4{t^4}\\hspace{0.25in}y\\left( \\pi \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}{\\pi ^4}\\]\nShow Solution \n\nLet\u2019s work one final example that looks more at interpreting a solution rather than finding a solution.\n\nExample 6 Find the solution to the following IVP and determine all possible behaviors of the solution as \\(t \\to \\infty \\).

Suppose that the solution above gave the temperature in a bar of metal. In this case we would want the solution(s) that remains finite in the long term. With this investigation we would now have the value of the initial condition that will give us that solution and more importantly values of the initial condition that we would need to avoid so that we didn\u2019t melt the bar.\n\n[Contact Me]\u00a0[Privacy Statement]\u00a0[Site Help & FAQ]\u00a0[Terms of Use]\n\u00a9 2003 - 2025 Paul Dawkins\nPage Last Modified : 8/1/2024\n\nSkip to content\nThe Open University\nStudy with The Open University\nAccessibility hub\nSearch for\nHome\nFree courses\nSubjects\nStudy skills\nWork skills\nHelp\nCreate account / Sign in\nSubjects\nScience, Maths & Technology\nFree courses\nIntroduction to differential equations\nFree course\nIntroduction to differential equations\nCourse description\nCourse content\nCourse reviews\n\nDifferential equations are any equations that include derivatives and arise in many situations. This free course, Introduction to differential equations, considers three types of first-order differential equations. Section 1 introduces equations that can be solved by direct integration and section 2 the method of separation of variables. Section 3 looks at applications of differential equations for solving real world problems. Section 4 introduces the integrating factor method for solving linear differential equations. The final two sections summarise and revise the methods introduced in the previous sections and describe various other approaches to finding solutions of first-order differential equations and to understanding the behaviour of the solutions.\n\nCourse learning outcomes\n\nAfter studying this course, you should be able to:\n\nrecognise differential equations that can be solved by each of the three methods \u2013 direct integration, separation of variables and integrating factor method \u2013 and use the appropriate method to solve them\nuse an initial condition to find a particular solution of a differential equation, given a general solution\ncheck a solution of a differential equation in explicit or implicit form, by substituting it into the differential equation\nunderstand the terms 'exponential growth/decay', 'proportionate growth rate' and 'doubling/halving time' when applied to population models, and the terms 'exponential decay', 'decay constant' and 'half-life' when applied to radioactivity\nsolve problems involving exponential growth and decay.\nEnter course\n\nFirst Published: 27/09/2017\n\nUpdated: 12/04/2018\n\nYour course resources\n\nAs you work through this course you will need various resources to help you complete some of the activities.\n\nthumbnail image\nFile\nCreate an account to get more\nTrack your progress\n\nReview and track your learning through your OpenLearn Profile.\n\nStatement of Participation\n\nOn completion of a course you will earn a Statement of Participation.\n\nAccess all course activities\n\nTake course quizzes and access all learning.\n\nReview the course\n\nWhen you have finished a course leave a review and tell others what you think.\n\nCreate account / Sign in\nCopyright information\n\nFor further information, take a look at our frequently asked questions which may give you the support you need.\n\nHave a question?\nMST125_2\nTake your learning further\n\nMaking the decision to study can be a big step, which is why you\u2019ll want a trusted University.

We will be using these same methods as we look at nonlinear systems of equations with two equations and two variables. A system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear.\n\nFor example each of the following systems is a system of nonlinear equations.\n\nSystem of Nonlinear Equations\n\nA system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear.\n\nJust as with systems of linear equations, a solution of a nonlinear system is an ordered pair that makes both equations true. In a nonlinear system, there may be more than one solution. We will see this as we solve a system of nonlinear equations by graphing.\n\nWhen we solved systems of linear equations, the solution of the system was the point of intersection of the two lines. With systems of nonlinear equations, the graphs may be circles, parabolas or hyperbolas and there may be several points of intersection, and so several solutions. Once you identify the graphs, visualize the different ways the graphs could intersect and so how many solutions there might be.\n\nTo solve systems of nonlinear equations by graphing, we use basically the same steps as with systems of linear equations modified slightly for nonlinear equations. The steps are listed below for reference.\n\nSolve a system of nonlinear equations by graphing.\nIdentify the graph of each equation. Sketch the possible options for intersection.\nGraph the first equation.\nGraph the second equation on the same rectangular coordinate system.\nDetermine whether the graphs intersect.\nIdentify the points of intersection.\nCheck that each ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.\n\nSolve the system by graphing: \n\nIdentify each graph.\t\nSketch the possible options for\nintersection of a parabola and a line.\t\nGraph the line, \nSlope-intercept form \nGraph the parabola, \t\nIdentify the points of intersection.\tThe points of intersection appear to be  and \nCheck to make sure each solution makes\nboth equations true.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tThe solutions are  and \n\nSolve the system by graphing: \n\nSolve the system by graphing: \n\nTo identify the graph of each equation, keep in mind the characteristics of the  and  terms of each conic.\n\nSolve the system by graphing: \n\nIdentify each graph.\t\nSketch the possible options for the\nintersection of a circle and a line.\t\nGraph the circle, \nCenter:  radius: 2\nGraph the line, \nIt is a horizontal line.\t\nIdentify the points of intersection.\tThe point of intersection appears to be \nCheck to make sure the solution makes\nboth equations true.\n\n\t\n\tThe solution is \n\nSolve the system by graphing: \n\nSolve the system by graphing: \n\nSolve a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Substitution\n\nThe graphing method works well when the points of intersection are integers and so easy to read off the graph. But more often it is difficult to read the coordinates of the points of intersection. The substitution method is an algebraic method that will work well in many situations. It works especially well when it is easy to solve one of the equations for one of the variables.\n\nThe substitution method is very similar to the substitution method that we used for systems of linear equations. The steps are listed below for reference.\n\nSolve a system of nonlinear equations by substitution.\nIdentify the graph of each equation. Sketch the possible options for intersection.\nSolve one of the equations for either variable.\nSubstitute the expression from Step 2 into the other equation.\nSolve the resulting equation.\nSubstitute each solution in Step 4 into one of the original equations to find the other variable.\nWrite each solution as an ordered pair.\nCheck that each ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.\n\nSolve the system by using substitution: \n\nIdentify each graph.\t\nSketch the possible options for intersection of an\nellipse and a line.\t\nThe equation  is solved for y.\t\n\t\nSubstitute  for y in the first equation.\t\nSolve the equation for x.\t\n\t\nSubstitute  and  into  to find y.\t\n\t\n\tThe ordered pairs are  \nCheck both ordered pairs in both equations.\n\n\n\n\t\n\tThe solutions are \n\nSolve the system by using substitution: \n\nNo solution\n\nSolve the system by using substitution: \n\nSo far, each system of nonlinear equations has had at least one solution. The next example will show another option.\n\nSolve the system by using substitution: \n\nIdentify each graph.\t\nSketch the possible options for\nintersection of a parabola and a line\t\nThe equation  is solved for y.\t\n\t\nSubstitute  for y in the first equation.\t\nSolve the equation for x.\t\nThis doesn\u2019t factor easily, so we can\ncheck the discriminant.\t\n\tThe discriminant is negative, so there is no real solution.\nThe system has no solution.\n\nSolve the system by using substitution: \n\nNo solution\n\nSolve the system by using substitution: \n\nSolve a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Elimination\n\nWhen we studied systems of linear equations, we used the method of elimination to solve the system. We can also use elimination to solve systems of nonlinear equations. It works well when the equations have both variables squared. When using elimination, we try to make the coefficients of one variable to be opposites, so when we add the equations together, that variable is eliminated.\n\nThe elimination method is very similar to the elimination method that we used for systems of linear equations. The steps are listed for reference.\n\nSolve a system of equations by elimination.\nIdentify the graph of each equation. Sketch the possible options for intersection.\nWrite both equations in standard form.\nMake the coefficients of one variable opposites.\nDecide which variable you will eliminate.\nMultiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.\nAdd the equations resulting from Step 3 to eliminate one variable.\nSolve for the remaining variable.\nSubstitute each solution from Step 5 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other variable.\nWrite each solution as an ordered pair.\nCheck that each ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.\n\nSolve the system by elimination: \n\nIdentify each graph.\t\nSketch the possible options for\nintersection of a circle and a parabola.\t\nBoth equations are in standard form.\t\nTo get opposite coefficients of \nwe will multiply the second equation by \t\nSimplify.\t\nAdd the two equations to eliminate \t\nSolve for y.\t\n\t\nSubstitute  and  into one of\nthe original equations.

These equations are common in a wide variety of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and engineering. We illustrate a few applications at the end of the section.\n\nSeparation of Variables\n\nWe start with a definition and some examples.\n\nDefinition: Separable Differential Equations\n\nA separable differential equation is any equation that can be written in the form\n\n\\[y'=f(x)g(y). \\label{sep} \\]\n\nThe term \u2018separable\u2019 refers to the fact that the right-hand side of Equation \\ref{sep} can be separated into a function of \\(x\\) times a function of \\(y\\). Examples of separable differential equations include\n\n\\[ \\begin{align} y' &=(x^2\u22124)(3y+2) \\label{eq1} \\\\[4pt] y' &=6x^2+4x \\label{eq2}\\\\[4pt] y' &=\\sec y+\\tan y \\label{eq3} \\\\[4pt] y' &=xy+3x\u22122y\u22126. \\label{eq4} \\end{align} \\]\n\nEquation \\ref{eq2} is separable with \\(f(x)=6x^2+4x\\) and \\(g(y)=1\\), Equation \\ref{eq3} is separable with \\(f(x)=1\\) and \\(g(y)=\\sec y+\\tan y,\\) and the right-hand side of Equation \\ref{eq4} can be factored as \\((x+3)(y\u22122)\\), so it is separable as well. Equation \\ref{eq3} is also called an autonomous differential equation because the right-hand side of the equation is a function of \\(y\\) alone. If a differential equation is separable, then it is possible to solve the equation using the method of separation of variables.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy: Separation of Variables\nCheck for any values of \\(y\\) that make \\(g(y)=0.\\) These correspond to constant solutions.\nRewrite the differential equation in the form \\[ \\dfrac{dy}{g(y)}=f(x)dx. \\nonumber \\]\nIntegrate both sides of the equation.\nSolve the resulting equation for \\(y\\) if possible.\nIf an initial condition exists, substitute the appropriate values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the equation and solve for the constant.\n\nNote that Step 4 states \u201cSolve the resulting equation for \\(y\\) if possible.\u201d It is not always possible to obtain \\(y\\) as an explicit function of \\(x\\). Quite often we have to be satisfied with finding y as an implicit function of \\(x\\).\n\nExample \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Using Separation of Variables\n\nFind a general solution to the differential equation \\(y'=(x^2\u22124)(3y+2)\\) using the method of separation of variables.\n\nSolution\n\nFollow the five-step method of separation of variables.\n\n1. In this example, \\(f(x)=x^2\u22124\\) and \\(g(y)=3y+2\\). Setting \\(g(y)=0\\) gives \\(y=\u2212\\dfrac{2}{3}\\) as a constant solution.\n\n2. Rewrite the differential equation in the form\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{dy}{3y+2}=(x^2\u22124)\\,dx.\\nonumber \\]\n\n3. Integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ \u222b\\dfrac{dy}{3y+2}=\u222b(x^2\u22124)\\,dx.\\nonumber \\]\n\nLet \\(u=3y+2\\). Then \\(du=3\\dfrac{dy}{dx}\\,dx\\), so the equation becomes\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{3}\u222b\\dfrac{1}{u}\\,du=\\dfrac{1}{3}x^3\u22124x+C\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{3}\\ln|u|=\\dfrac{1}{3}x^3\u22124x+C\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{3}\\ln|3y+2|=\\dfrac{1}{3}x^3\u22124x+C.\\nonumber \\]\n\n4. To solve this equation for \\(y\\), first multiply both sides of the equation by \\(3\\).\n\n\\[ \\ln|3y+2|=x^3\u221212x+3C\\nonumber \\]\n\nNow we use some logic in dealing with the constant \\(C\\). Since \\(C\\) represents an arbitrary constant, \\(3C\\) also represents an arbitrary constant. If we call the second arbitrary constant \\(C_1,\\) where \\(C_1 = 3C,\\) the equation becomes\n\n\\[ \\ln|3y+2|=x^3\u221212x+C_1.\\nonumber \\]\n\nNow exponentiate both sides of the equation (i.e., make each side of the equation the exponent for the base \\(e\\)).\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*} e^{\\ln|3y+2|} &=e^{x^3\u221212x+C_1} \\\\ |3y+2| &=e^{C_1}e^{x^3\u221212x} \\end{align*}\\]\n\nAgain define a new constant \\(C_2= e^{C_1}\\) (note that \\(C_2 > 0\\)):\n\n\\[ |3y+2|=C_2e^{x^3\u221212x}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nBecause of the absolute value on the left side of the equation, this corresponds to two separate equations:\n\n\\[3y+2=C_2e^{x^3\u221212x}\\nonumber \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[3y+2=\u2212C_2e^{x^3\u221212x}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nThe solution to either equation can be written in the form\n\n\\[y=\\dfrac{\u22122\u00b1C_2e^{x^3\u221212x}}{3}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nSince \\(C_2>0\\), it does not matter whether we use plus or minus, so the constant can actually have either sign. Furthermore, the subscript on the constant \\(C\\) is entirely arbitrary, and can be dropped. Therefore the solution can be written as\n\n\\[ y=\\dfrac{\u22122+Ce^{x^3\u221212x}}{3}, \\text{ where }C = \\pm C_2\\text{ or } C = 0.\\nonumber \\]\n\nNote that in writing a single general solution in this way, we are also allowing \\(C\\) to equal \\(0\\). This gives us the singular solution, \\(y = -\\dfrac{2}{3}\\), for the given differential equation. Check that this is indeed a solution of this differential equation!\n\n5. No initial condition is imposed, so we are finished.\n\nExercise \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)\n\nUse the method of separation of variables to find a general solution to the differential equation\n\n\\[ y'=2xy+3y\u22124x\u22126. \\nonumber \\]\n\nHint\nAnswer\nExample \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): Solving an Initial-Value Problem\n\nUsing the method of separation of variables, solve the initial-value problem\n\n\\[ y'=(2x+3)(y^2\u22124),\\quad y(0)=\u22121.\\nonumber \\]\n\nSolution\n\nFollow the five-step method of separation of variables.\n\n1. In this example, \\(f(x)=2x+3\\) and \\(g(y)=y^2\u22124\\). Setting \\(g(y)=0\\) gives \\(y=\u00b12\\) as constant solutions.\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by \\(y^2\u22124\\) and multiply by \\(dx\\). This gives the equation\n\n\\[\\dfrac{dy}{y^2\u22124}=(2x+3)\\,dx.\\nonumber \\]\n\n3. Next integrate both sides:\n\n\\[\u222b\\dfrac{1}{y^2\u22124}dy=\u222b(2x+3)\\,dx. \\label{Ex2.2} \\]\n\nTo evaluate the left-hand side, use the method of partial fraction decomposition. This leads to the identity\n\n\\[\\dfrac{1}{y^2\u22124}=\\dfrac{1}{4}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{y\u22122}\u2212\\dfrac{1}{y+2}\\right).\\nonumber \\]\n\nThen Equation \\ref{Ex2.2} becomes\n\n\\[\\dfrac{1}{4}\u222b\\left(\\dfrac{1}{y\u22122}\u2212\\dfrac{1}{y+2}\\right)dy=\u222b(2x+3)\\,dx\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[\\dfrac{1}{4}\\left (\\ln|y\u22122|\u2212\\ln|y+2| \\right)=x^2+3x+C.\\nonumber \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides of this equation by \\(4\\) and replacing \\(4C\\) with \\(C_1\\) gives\n\n\\[\\ln|y\u22122|\u2212\\ln|y+2|=4x^2+12x+C_1\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[\\ln \\left|\\dfrac{y\u22122}{y+2}\\right|=4x^2+12x+C_1.\\nonumber \\]\n\n4. It is possible to solve this equation for \\(y.\\) First exponentiate both sides of the equation and define \\(C_2=e^{C_1}\\):\n\n\\[\\left|\\dfrac{y\u22122}{y+2}\\right|=C_2e^{4x^2+12x}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nNext we can remove the absolute value and let a new constant \\(C_3\\) be positive, negative, or zero, i.e., \\(C_3 =\\pm C_2\\) or \\(C_3 = 0.\\)\n\nThen multiply both sides by \\(y+2\\).\n\n\\[y\u22122=C_3(y+2)e^{4x^2+12x}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[y\u22122=C_3ye^{4x^2+12x}+2C_3e^{4x^2+12x}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nNow collect all terms involving \\(y\\) on one side of the equation, and solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[y\u2212C_3ye^{4x^2+12x}=2+2C_3e^{4x^2+12x}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[y\\big(1\u2212C_3e^{4x^2+12x}\\big)=2+2C_3e^{4x^2+12x}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[y=\\dfrac{2+2C_3e^{4x^2+12x}}{1\u2212C_3e^{4x^2+12x}}.\\nonumber \\]\n\n5. To determine the value of \\(C_3\\), substitute \\(x=0\\) and \\(y=\u22121\\) into the general solution. Alternatively, we can put the same values into an earlier equation, namely the equation \\(\\dfrac{y\u22122}{y+2}=C_3e^{4x^2+12}\\). This is much easier to solve for \\(C_3\\):\n\n\\[\\dfrac{y\u22122}{y+2}=C_3e^{4x^2+12x}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[\\dfrac{\u22121\u22122}{\u22121+2}=C_3e^{4(0)^2+12(0)}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[C_3=\u22123.\\nonumber \\]\n\nTherefore the solution to the initial-value problem is\n\n\\[y=\\dfrac{2\u22126e^{4x^2+12x}}{1+3e^{4x^2+12x}}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nA graph of this solution appears in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\).\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Graph of the solution to the initial-value problem \\(y'=(2x+3)(y^2\u22124),y(0)=\u22121\\).\nExercise \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)\n\nFind the solution to the initial-value problem\n\n\\[ 6y'=(2x+1)(y^2\u22122y\u22128) \\nonumber \\]\n\nwith \\(y(0)=\u22123\\) using the method of separation of variables.\n\nHint\nAnswer\nApplications of Separation of Variables\n\nMany interesting problems can be described by separable equations. We illustrate two types of problems: solution concentrations and Newton\u2019s law of cooling.\n\nSolution concentrations\n\nConsider a tank being filled with a salt solution. We would like to determine the amount of salt present in the tank as a function of time. We can apply the process of separation of variables to solve this problem and similar problems involving solution concentrations.\n\nExample \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\): Determining Salt Concentration over Time\n\nA tank containing \\(100\\) L of a brine solution initially has \\(4\\) kg of salt dissolved in the solution. At time \\(t=0\\), another brine solution flows into the tank at a rate of \\(2\\) L/min. This brine solution contains a concentration of \\(0.5\\) kg/L of salt. At the same time, a stopcock is opened at the bottom of the tank, allowing the combined solution to flow out at a rate of \\(2\\) L/min, so that the level of liquid in the tank remains constant (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)). Find the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time (measured in minutes), and find the limiting amount of salt in the tank, assuming that the solution in the tank is well mixed at all times.\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): A brine tank with an initial amount of salt solution accepts an input flow and delivers an output flow. How does the amount of salt change with time?\nSolution\n\nFirst we define a function \\(u(t)\\) that represents the amount of salt in kilograms in the tank as a function of time. Then \\(\\dfrac{du}{dt}\\) represents the rate at which the amount of salt in the tank changes as a function of time. Also, \\(u(0)\\) represents the amount of salt in the tank at time \\(t=0\\), which is \\(4\\) kilograms.\n\nThe general setup for the differential equation we will solve is of the form\n\n\\[\\dfrac{du}{dt}=\\text{INFLOW RATE \u2212 OUTFLOW RATE.} \\nonumber \\]\n\nINFLOW RATE represents the rate at which salt enters the tank, and OUTFLOW RATE represents the rate at which salt leaves the tank. Because solution enters the tank at a rate of \\(2\\) L/min, and each liter of solution contains \\(0.5\\) kilogram of salt, every minute \\(2(0.5)=1\\) kilogram of salt enters the tank. Therefore INFLOW RATE = \\(1\\).\n\nTo calculate the rate at which salt leaves the tank, we need the concentration of salt in the tank at any point in time. Since the actual amount of salt varies over time, so does the concentration of salt. However, the volume of the solution remains fixed at 100 liters. The number of kilograms of salt in the tank at time \\(t\\) is equal to \\(u(t)\\). Thus, the concentration of salt is \\(\\dfrac{u(t)}{100}\\) kg/L, and the solution leaves the tank at a rate of \\(2\\) L/min. Therefore salt leaves the tank at a rate of \\(\\dfrac{u(t)}{100}\u22c52=\\dfrac{u(t)}{50}\\) kg/min, and OUTFLOW RATE is equal to \\(\\dfrac{u(t)}{50}\\). Therefore the differential equation becomes \\(\\dfrac{du}{dt}=1\u2212\\dfrac{u}{50}\\), and the initial condition is \\(u(0)=4.\\) The initial-value problem to be solved is\n\n\\[\\dfrac{du}{dt}=1\u2212\\dfrac{u}{50},u(0)=4.\\nonumber \\]\n\nThe differential equation is a separable equation, so we can apply the five-step strategy for solution.\n\nStep 1. Setting \\(1\u2212\\dfrac{u}{50}=0\\) gives \\(u=50\\) as a constant solution. Since the initial amount of salt in the tank is \\(4\\) kilograms, this solution does not apply.\n\nStep 2. Rewrite the equation as\n\n\\[\\dfrac{du}{dt}=\\dfrac{50\u2212u}{50}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nThen multiply both sides by \\(dt\\) and divide both sides by \\(50\u2212u:\\)\n\n\\[\\dfrac{du}{50\u2212u}=\\dfrac{dt}{50}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nStep 3. Integrate both sides:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \u222b\\dfrac{du}{50\u2212u} &=\u222b\\dfrac{dt}{50} \\\\ \u2212\\ln|50\u2212u| &=\\dfrac{t}{50}+C. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nStep 4. Solve for \\(u(t)\\):\n\n\\[\\ln|50\u2212u|=\u2212\\dfrac{t}{50}\u2212C\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[e^{\\ln|50\u2212u|}=e^{\u2212(t/50)\u2212C}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[|50\u2212u|=C_1e^{\u2212t/50}, \\text{ where } C_1 = e^{-C}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nEliminate the absolute value by allowing the constant to be positive, negative, or zero, i.e., \\(C_1 = \\pm e^{-C}\\) or \\(C_1 = 0\\):\n\n\\[50\u2212u=C_1e^{\u2212t/50}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nFinally, solve for \\(u(t)\\):\n\n\\[u(t)=50\u2212C_1e^{\u2212t/50}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nStep 5. Solve for \\(C_1\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} u(0) &=50\u2212C_1e^{\u22120/50} \\\\ 4 &=50\u2212C_1 \\\\ C_1 &=46. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe solution to the initial value problem is \\(u(t)=50\u221246e^{\u2212t/50}.\\) To find the limiting amount of salt in the tank, take the limit as \\(t\\) approaches infinity:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\lim_{t\u2192\u221e}u(t) &=50\u221246e^{\u2212t/50} \\\\ &=50\u221246(0)=50. \\end{align*}\\]\n\nNote that this was the constant solution to the differential equation. If the initial amount of salt in the tank is \\(50\\) kilograms, then it remains constant. If it starts at less than \\(50\\) kilograms, then it approaches \\(50\\) kilograms over time.\n\nExercise \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)\n\nA tank contains \\(3\\) kilograms of salt dissolved in \\(75\\) liters of water. A salt solution of \\(0.4\\) kg salt/L is pumped into the tank at a rate of \\(6\\) L/min and is drained at the same rate. Solve for the salt concentration at time \\(t\\). Assume the tank is well mixed at all times.\n\nHint\nAnswer\nNewton\u2019s Law of Cooling\n\nNewton\u2019s law of cooling states that the rate of change of an object\u2019s temperature is proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the ambient temperature (i.e., the temperature of its surroundings). If we let \\(T(t)\\) represent the temperature of an object as a function of time, then \\(\\dfrac{dT}{dt}\\) represents the rate at which that temperature changes. The temperature of the object\u2019s surroundings can be represented by \\(T_s\\). Then Newton\u2019s law of cooling can be written in the form\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{dT}{dt}=k(T(t)\u2212T_s) \\nonumber \\]\n\nor simply\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{dT}{dt}=k(T\u2212T_s). \\nonumber \\]\n\nThe temperature of the object at the beginning of any experiment is the initial value for the initial-value problem. We call this temperature \\(T_0\\). Therefore the initial-value problem that needs to be solved takes the form\n\n\\[ \\dfrac{dT}{dt}=k(T\u2212T_s) \\label{newton} \\]\n\nwith \\(T(0)=T_0\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant that needs to be either given or determined in the context of the problem. We use these equations in Example \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\).\n\nExample \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Waiting for a Pizza to Cool\n\nA pizza is removed from the oven after baking thoroughly, and the temperature of the oven is \\(350\u00b0F.\\) The temperature of the kitchen is \\(75\u00b0F\\), and after \\(5\\) minutes the temperature of the pizza is \\(340\u00b0F\\). We would like to wait until the temperature of the pizza reaches \\(300\u00b0F\\) before cutting and serving it (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)). How much longer will we have to wait?\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\): From Newton\u2019s law of cooling, if the pizza cools \\(10\u00b0F\\) in \\(5\\) minutes, how long before it cools to \\(300\u00b0F\\)?\nSolution\n\nThe ambient temperature (surrounding temperature) is \\(75\u00b0F\\), so \\(T_s=75\\). The temperature of the pizza when it comes out of the oven is \\(350\u00b0F\\), which is the initial temperature (i.e., initial value), so \\(T_0=350\\). Therefore Equation \\ref{newton} becomes\n\n\\[\\dfrac{dT}{dt}=k(T\u221275) \\nonumber \\]\n\nwith \\(T(0)=350.\\)\n\nTo solve the differential equation, we use the five-step technique for solving separable equations.\n\n1. Setting the right-hand side equal to zero gives \\(T=75\\) as a constant solution. Since the pizza starts at \\(350\u00b0F,\\) this is not the solution we are seeking.\n\n2. Rewrite the differential equation by multiplying both sides by \\(dt\\) and dividing both sides by \\(T\u221275\\):\n\n\\[\\dfrac{dT}{T\u221275}=k\\,dt. \\nonumber \\]\n\n3. Integrate both sides:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \u222b\\dfrac{dT}{T\u221275} &=\u222bk\\,dt \\\\ \\ln|T\u221275| &=kt+C.\\end{align*} \\nonumber \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\(T\\) by first exponentiating both sides:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}e^{\\ln|T\u221275|} &=e^{kt+C} \\\\ |T\u221275| &=C_1e^{kt}, & & \\text{where } C_1 = e^C. \\\\ T\u221275 &=\\pm C_1e^{kt} \\\\ T\u221275 &=Ce^{kt}, & & \\text{where } C = \\pm C_1\\text{ or } C = 0.\\\\ T(t) &=75+Ce^{kt}. \\end{align*} \\nonumber \\]\n\n5. Solve for \\(C\\) by using the initial condition \\(T(0)=350:\\)\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}T(t) &=75+Ce^{kt}\\\\ T(0) &=75+Ce^{k(0)} \\\\ 350 &=75+C \\\\ C &=275.\\end{align*} \\nonumber \\]\n\nTherefore the solution to the initial-value problem is\n\n\\[T(t)=75+275e^{kt}.\\nonumber \\]\n\nTo determine the value of \\(k\\), we need to use the fact that after \\(5\\) minutes the temperature of the pizza is \\(340\u00b0F\\). Therefore \\(T(5)=340.\\) Substituting this information into the solution to the initial-value problem, we have\n\n\\[T(t)=75+275e^{kt}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[T(5)=340=75+275e^{5k}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[265=275e^{5k}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[e^{5k}=\\dfrac{53}{55}\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[\\ln e^{5k}=\\ln(\\dfrac{53}{55})\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[5k=\\ln(\\dfrac{53}{55})\\nonumber \\]\n\n\\[k=\\dfrac{1}{5}\\ln(\\dfrac{53}{55})\u2248\u22120.007408.\\nonumber \\]\n\nSo now we have \\(T(t)=75+275e^{\u22120.007048t}.\\) When is the temperature \\(300\u00b0F\\)?

Equations\n\nA review of how to solve first order linear equations by use of an integrating factor.\n\nThe Essentials\n\nFirst order linear differential equations can be written in the form:\n\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n+\n\ud835\udc5d\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\ud835\udc66\n=\n\ud835\udc53\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\nAfter the equation is in this form, multiply both sides of the equation by the integration factor mu (\u03bc) where mu is:\n\n\ud835\udf07\n=\n\ud835\udc52\n\u222b\n\ud835\udc5d\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n+\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc5d\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\ud835\udc66\n=\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc53\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\nNext,

for y:\n\n\u222b\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n(\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc66\n)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n=\n\u222b\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc53\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc66\n=\n\u222b\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc53\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc66\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n=\n\u222b\n\ud835\udf07\n\ud835\udc53\n(\n\ud835\udc65\n)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udf07\nExample\n\nSolve

Solutions\n Prev. Section  Notes  Next Section \n\u00a0\nSection 6.3 : Series Solutions\n\nBefore we get into finding series solutions to differential equations we need to determine when we can find series solutions to differential equations. So, let\u2019s start with the differential equation,\n\np(x)y\u2033\n\nThis time we really do mean nonconstant coefficients. To this point we\u2019ve only dealt with constant coefficients. However, with series solutions we can now have nonconstant coefficient differential equations. Also, in order to make the problems a little nicer we will be dealing only with polynomial coefficients.\n\nNow, we say that x=x_{0} is an ordinary point if provided both\n\n\\frac{{q\\left( x \\right)}}{{p\\left( x \\right)}}\\,\\,\\hspace{0.25in}{\\mbox{and}}\\hspace{0.25in}\\frac{{r\\left( x \\right)}}{{p\\left( x \\right)}}\n\nare analytic at x=x_{0}. That is to say that these two quantities have Taylor series around x=x_{0}. We are going to be only dealing with coefficients that are polynomials so this will be equivalent to saying that\n\np\\left( {{x_0}} \\right) \\ne 0\n\nfor most of the problems.\n\nIf a point is not an ordinary point we call it a singular point.\n\nThe basic idea to finding a series solution to a differential equation is to assume that we can write the solution as a power series in the form,\n\n\\begin{equation}y\\left( x \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty {{a_n}{{\\left( {x - {x_0}} \\right)}^n}} \\label{eq:eq2}\\end{equation}\n\nand then try to determine what the a_{n}\u2019s need to be. We will only be able to do this if the point x=x_{0}, is an ordinary point. We will usually say that \\eqref{eq:eq2} is a series solution around x=x_{0}.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a very basic example of this. In fact, it will be so basic that we will have constant coefficients. This will allow us to check that we get the correct solution.\n\nExample 1 Determine a series solution for the following differential equation about {x_0} = 0.\n\ny'' + y = 0\nShow Solution \n\nBefore working another problem let\u2019s take a look at the solution to the previous example. First, we started out by saying that we wanted a series solution of the form,\n\ny\\left( x \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty {{a_n}{x^n}}\n\nand we didn\u2019t get that. We got a solution that contained two different power series. Also, each of the solutions had an unknown constant in them. This is not a problem. In fact, it\u2019s what we want to have happen. From our work with second order constant coefficient differential equations we know that the solution to the differential equation in the last example is,\n\ny\\left( x \\right) = {c_1}\\cos \\left( x \\right) + {c_2}\\sin \\left( x \\right)\n\nSolutions to second order differential equations consist of two separate functions each with an unknown constant in front of them that are found by applying any initial conditions. So, the form of our solution in the last example is exactly what we want to get. Also recall that the following Taylor series,\n\n\\cos \\left( x \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^n}{x^{2n}}}}{{\\left( {2n} \\right)!}}} \\hspace{0.25in}\\sin \\left( x \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^\\infty {\\frac{{{{\\left( { - 1} \\right)}^n}{x^{2n + 1}}}}{{\\left( {2n + 1} \\right)!}}}\n\nRecalling these we very quickly see that what we got from the series solution method was exactly the solution we got from first principles, with the exception that the functions were the Taylor series for the actual functions instead of the actual functions themselves.\n\nNow let\u2019s work an example with nonconstant coefficients since that is where series solutions are most useful.\n\nExample 2 Find a series solution around {x_0} = 0 for the following differential equation.\n\ny'' - xy = 0\nShow Solution \n\nNow, we need to work an example in which we use a point other that x=0. In fact, let\u2019s just take the previous example and rework it for a different value of x_{0}. We\u2019re also going to need to change up the instructions a little for this example.\n\nExample 3 Find the first four terms in each portion of the series solution around {x_0} = - 2 for the following differential equation.\n\ny'' - xy = 0\nShow Solution \n\nLet\u2019s work one final problem.\n\nExample 4 Find the first four terms in each portion of the series solution around {x_0} = 0 for the following differential equation.\n\n\\left( {{x^2} + 1} \\right)y'' - 4xy' + 6y = 0\nShow Solution \n[Contact Me]\u00a0[Privacy Statement]\u00a0[Site Help & FAQ]\u00a0[Terms of Use]\n\u00a9 2003 - 2025 Paul Dawkins\nPage Last Modified : 11/16/2022",

    "Introduction to Differential Equations": "Introduction to Differential Equations is a course that covers the basics of differential equations, including the definition, classification, and methods for solving first-order and higher-order linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). The course introduces the concept of differential equations, including the order, linear vs. nonlinear, initial conditions, initial value problem, and interval of validity. It also covers direction fields, which are used to determine some of the behavior of solutions to differential equations.\n\nThe course covers several types of first-order differential equations, including separable, linear, and exact equations. It also introduces the method of substitution, autonomous equations, and numerical methods such as Euler's method. For higher-order linear ODEs, the course covers constant coefficient second-order linear ODEs, mechanical vibrations, nonhomogeneous equations, forced oscillations, and resonance.\n\nThe course also introduces the Laplace transform, which is used to solve differential equations, as well as power series methods, including series solutions of linear second-order ODEs and singular points. Additionally, it covers Fourier series and PDEs, including boundary value problems and the trigonometric series.\n\nThroughout the course, applications of differential equations in real-world problems are addressed, including modeling physical situations with first-order differential equations. The course provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, including key concepts, definitions, and methods used to solve differential equations, making it an ideal introduction to the subject.",
    "Separation of Variables and Integrating Factors": "Separation of Variables and Integrating Factors are two important methods used to solve differential equations. \n\nSeparation of Variables is a method used to solve certain types of differential equations by separating the variables to opposite sides of the equation, making it easier to integrate. This method is commonly used to solve separable differential equations, which are equations that can be written in the form y' = f(x)g(y). The method involves separating the variables and then integrating to find the solution.\n\nIntegrating Factors are used in the method for solving first-order linear differential equations, where an integrating factor is multiplied with the equation to make it exact, thus allowing for a straightforward solution. The steps involved in solving a first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor include putting the equation into standard form, calculating the integrating factor, multiplying both sides by the integrating factor, and integrating both sides.\n\nBoth methods are widely used in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and engineering, to solve differential equations that model real-world phenomena. By applying these methods, one can find the solutions to these equations, which can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the systems being modeled.\n\nIn summary, Separation of Variables and Integrating Factors are two powerful tools used to solve differential equations, and understanding how to apply these methods is essential for anyone working with differential equations.",
    "First Order Linear Differential Equations and Applications": "A first-order linear differential equation is an equation of the form $a(x)y\u2032+b(x)y=c(x)$, where $a(x)$, $b(x)$, and $c(x)$ are arbitrary functions of $x$. The standard form of the equation is $y\u2032 + p(x)y = q(x)$, where $p(x) = \\frac{b(x)}{a(x)}$ and $q(x) = \\frac{c(x)}{a(x)}$. The integrating factor for this equation is given by $\\mu(x) = e^{\\int p(x) dx}$. The general solution to the equation is given by $y(x) = \\frac{1}{\\mu(x)} \\int \\mu(x) q(x) dx + \\frac{C}{\\mu(x)}$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. First-order linear differential equations have many applications in physics, engineering, and other fields, and can be used to model population growth, chemical reactions, and electrical circuits, among other things.",
    "Higher Order Linear Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients": "Higher Order Linear Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients are equations of the form $y^{(n)} + p_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \\cdots + p_1(x) y' + p_0(x) y = 0$, where $p_{n-1}(x), \\ldots, p_1(x), p_0(x)$ are constant coefficients. The basic results about linear ODEs of higher order are essentially the same as for second order equations, with 2 replaced by $n$. The important concept of linear independence is somewhat more complicated when more than two functions are involved. For higher order constant coefficient ODEs, the methods developed are also somewhat harder to apply. \n\nMethods for solving Higher Order Linear Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients include:\n1. **Undetermined Coefficients**: This method can be used to solve higher order equations, with only a small natural extension from the method used for second order equations.\n2. **Variation of Parameters**: This method can also be used to solve higher order equations.\n3. **Characteristic Polynomial**: The characteristic polynomial is an important tool for solving higher order equations, and finding all the roots of the characteristic polynomial is the main difficulty in the higher order cases.\n\nKey concepts for nth order linear equations include:\n1. **Principle of Superposition**: This principle states that the solution to a linear homogeneous equation is a linear combination of linearly independent solutions.\n2. **Linearly Independent Functions**: A set of functions is said to be linearly independent if none of the functions can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.\n3. **Wronskian**: The Wronskian is a determinant that can be used to determine whether a set of functions is linearly independent.\n\nOverall, Higher Order Linear Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients can be solved using a variety of methods, including undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters, and the characteristic polynomial. The key concepts of linear independence, the Principle of Superposition, and the Wronskian are also important for understanding and solving these equations.",
    "Series Solutions and Special Functions for Non-Linear Equations": "Series Solutions and Special Functions for Non-Linear Equations can be used to solve a wide range of problems in mathematics and science. \n\nA system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear. The solution of a nonlinear system is an ordered pair that makes both equations true. In a nonlinear system, there may be more than one solution.\n\nMethods for solving systems of nonlinear equations include graphing, substitution, and elimination. Graphing involves visualizing the graphs of the equations and finding the points of intersection. Substitution involves solving one equation for one variable and substituting that expression into the other equation. Elimination involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\nSeries solutions to differential equations can be used to solve equations with nonconstant coefficients. The concept of an ordinary point is important in determining when a series solution can be found. Polynomial coefficients are often used to make the problems more tractable.\n\nSpecial functions for non-linear equations, such as the Wronskian, can be used to determine if two functions are linearly independent or linearly dependent. The Wronskian can also be used to find the general solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation.\n\nIn conclusion, Series Solutions and Special Functions for Non-Linear Equations are powerful tools for solving a wide range of problems in mathematics and science. By understanding the methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations and the concepts of series solutions to differential equations, we can tackle complex problems with confidence."

    "**Introduction to Differential Equations**\n=====================================================\n\nWelcome, students, to today's lecture on differential equations. Differential equations are equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives. They are used to model a wide range of phenomena in physics, engineering, and other fields. Can you think of any real-world examples where differential equations might be used? Perhaps the motion of an object, the growth of a population, or the spread of a disease?\n\nThese equations are crucial in understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems. For instance, in physics, differential equations are used to describe the motion of objects, the flow of fluids, and the behavior of electrical circuits. In biology, they are used to model the growth of populations, the spread of diseases, and the behavior of complex biological systems.\n\n**Definition and Classification**\n--------------------------------\n\nNow, let's dive into the definition and classification of differential equations. Differential equations can be classified into two main categories: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). ODEs involve functions of one variable, while PDEs involve functions of multiple variables.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider a simple example. The equation y' = 2x is an ODE, as it involves a function of one variable, y, and its derivative with respect to x. On the other hand, the equation \u2202u/\u2202t = \u2202^2u/\u2202x^2 is a PDE, as it involves a function of two variables, u(x,t), and its partial derivatives with respect to x and t.\n\n**Order of a Differential Equation**\n------------------------------------\n\nThe order of a differential equation is the highest order of the derivative that appears in the equation. For example, the equation y'' + 2y' + y = 0 is a second-order ODE, as the highest derivative is y''.\n\nLet's consider another example. The equation y''' + 3y'' + 2y' + y = 0 is a fourth-order ODE. Can you think of a real-world scenario where a fourth-order ODE might be used?\n\n**Linear vs. Nonlinear Differential Equations**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA linear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable and its derivatives appear in a linear combination. A nonlinear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable or its derivatives appear in a nonlinear combination.\n\nFor example, the equation y' + 2y = 0 is a linear differential equation, as y and its derivative appear in a linear combination. On the other hand, the equation y' + y^2 = 0 is a nonlinear differential equation, as y appears in a nonlinear combination.\n\n**Initial Conditions and Initial Value Problem**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nAn initial condition is a condition that specifies the value of the dependent variable at a particular point. An initial value problem is a differential equation with one or more initial conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the differential equation y' + 2y = 0 with the initial condition y(0) = 1. This is an initial value problem, as we are given the value of y at x=0.\n\n**Direction Fields**\n------------------\n\nA direction field is a graphical representation of the solutions to a differential equation. It is used to determine the behavior of the solutions.\n\nImagine you are hiking in the mountains, and you want to know the direction of the trails. A direction field would be like a map that shows the direction of the trails at each point. Similarly, a direction field for a differential equation shows the direction of the solutions at each point.\n\n**First-Order Differential Equations**\n------------------------------------\n\nFirst-order differential equations involve functions of one variable and their first derivatives. Examples include separable, linear, and exact equations.\n\nLet's consider a simple example. The equation dy/dx = f(x) is a separable differential equation, as we can separate the variables and integrate both sides.\n\n**Euler's Method**\n----------------\n\nEuler's method is a numerical method for solving differential equations. It involves approximating the solution at a given point using the solution at a previous point.\n\nThe code `y[i+1] = y[i] + hf(x[i], y[i])` illustrates Euler's method. Here, `y[i]` is the solution at the previous point, `x[i]` is the independent variable, and `f(x[i], y[i])` is the function that defines the differential equation.\n\n**Higher-Order Linear ODEs**\n---------------------------\n\nHigher-order linear ODEs involve functions of one variable and their higher-order derivatives. Examples include constant coefficient second-order linear ODEs and mechanical vibrations.\n\nThe equation y'' + 2y' + y = 0 is a constant coefficient second-order linear ODE. Can you think of a real-world scenario where this equation might be used?\n\n**Laplace Transform**\n-------------------\n\nThe Laplace transform is a method for solving differential equations. It involves transforming the differential equation into an algebraic equation, which can then be solved.\n\nThe code `F(s) = \u222b[0,\u221e) f(t)e^(-st)dt` illustrates the Laplace transform. Here, `f(t)` is the function that defines the differential equation, and `s` is the independent variable.\n\n**Power Series Methods**\n----------------------\n\nPower series methods involve representing the solution to a differential equation as a power series. This can be used to solve linear second-order ODEs and other types of differential equations.\n\nThe code `y(x) = \u2211[n=0,\u221e] a_n x^n` illustrates a power series solution. Here, `a_n` are the coefficients of the power series, and `x` is the independent variable.\n\n**Introduction to Separation of Variables and Integrating Factors**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeparation of Variables and Integrating Factors are two important methods used to solve differential equations. These methods are widely used in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and engineering, to solve differential equations that model real-world phenomena.\n\n**Separation of Variables Method**\n--------------------------------\n\nThis method is used to solve certain types of differential equations by separating the variables to opposite sides of the equation, making it easier to integrate. The equation should be in the form y' = f(x)g(y).\n\nFor example, consider the differential equation dy/dx = x/y. We can separate the variables by multiplying both sides by y and dividing both sides by x, giving us ydy = xdx.\n\n**Steps for Separation of Variables**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe steps involved in solving a differential equation using Separation of Variables include:\n\n1. Separating the variables\n2. Integrating both sides\n3. Solving for y\n\nLet's consider the example dy/dx = x/y. We can separate the variables by multiplying both sides by y and dividing both sides by x, giving us ydy = xdx. Integrating both sides, we get \u222bydy = \u222bxdx, which gives us y^2/2 = x^2/2 + C.\n\n**Integrating Factors Method**\n---------------------------\n\nIntegrating Factors are used to solve first-order linear differential equations. An integrating factor is multiplied with the equation to make it exact, thus allowing for a straightforward solution.\n\nFor example, consider the differential equation dy/dx + 2y = 3. We can multiply both sides by an integrating factor, \u03bc(x), to make the equation exact.\n\n**Steps for Integrating Factors**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe steps involved in solving a first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor include:\n\n1. Putting the equation into standard form\n2. Calculating the integrating factor\n3. Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor\n4. Integrating both sides\n\nLet's consider the example dy/dx + 2y = 3. We can put the equation into standard form by multiplying both sides by an integrating factor, \u03bc(x) = e^\u222b2dx = e^2x. Multiplying both sides by \u03bc(x), we get \u03bc(x)dy/dx + \u03bc(x)2y = \u03bc(x)3, which simplifies to d(\u03bc(x)y)/dx = \u03bc(x)3.\n\n**Example of Separation of Variables**\n--------------------------------------\n\nConsider the differential equation dy/dx = x/y. We can use Separation of Variables to solve this equation.\n\nSeparating the variables, we get ydy = xdx. Integrating both sides, we get \u222bydy = \u222bxdx, which gives us y^2/2 = x^2/2 + C.\n\n**Example of Integrating Factors**\n---------------------------------\n\nConsider the differential equation dy/dx + 2y = 3. We can use Integrating Factors to solve this equation.\n\nMultiplying both sides by an integrating factor, \u03bc(x) = e^\u222b2dx = e^2x, we get \u03bc(x)dy/dx + \u03bc(x)2y = \u03bc(x)3, which simplifies to d(\u03bc(x)y)/dx = \u03bc(x)3. Integrating both sides, we get \u03bc(x)y = \u222b\u03bc(x)3dx, which gives us e^2x*y = (3/2)e^2x + C.\n\nI hope this lecture has provided a comprehensive introduction to differential equations and their solutions. Remember to practice solving different types of differential equations to become proficient in this topic. Thank you for your attention, and I welcome any questions you may have.",
    "**Introduction to Differential Equations**\n====================================================\n\nWelcome, students, to today's lecture on differential equations. Differential equations are a crucial part of mathematics and are used to model various phenomena in physics, engineering, and other fields. But what exactly are differential equations? Simply put, they are equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives. Think of it like this: imagine you're trying to model the population growth of a city. You would use a differential equation to describe how the population changes over time, taking into account factors like birth rates, death rates, and migration.\n\nFor instance, consider a simple example of a differential equation that models the growth of a population. Let's say we have a population of rabbits on an island, and we want to model how the population grows over time. We could use a differential equation like this: dP/dt = rP, where P is the population size, r is the growth rate, and t is time. This equation tells us that the rate of change of the population size is proportional to the current population size.\n\n**Definition and Classification**\n---------------------------------\n\nNow, let's dive into the definition and classification of differential equations. Differential equations can be classified into two main categories: ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). ODEs involve functions of one variable, while PDEs involve functions of multiple variables. To illustrate the difference, consider a simple example of an ODE: y' + 2y = 0. This equation involves a function of one variable, y, and its derivative. On the other hand, a PDE like the wave equation, \u2202\u00b2u/\u2202t\u00b2 = c\u00b2\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2, involves a function of multiple variables, u(x,t), and its partial derivatives.\n\nFor example, consider a mechanical system like a pendulum. We could use an ODE to model the motion of the pendulum, taking into account factors like gravity, friction, and the initial conditions of the pendulum. On the other hand, if we wanted to model the behavior of a wave propagating through a medium, we would use a PDE like the wave equation.\n\n**Order of a Differential Equation**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe order of a differential equation is the highest order of the derivative that appears in the equation. For example, the equation y'' + 2y' + y = 0 is a second-order ODE. But why is the order of a differential equation important? Well, it tells us about the complexity of the equation and the number of initial conditions required to solve it. Think of it like this: if you're trying to solve a puzzle, you need to know how many pieces you're working with. In the same way, knowing the order of a differential equation helps us determine how many initial conditions we need to specify in order to find a unique solution.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the example of a second-order ODE like y'' + 2y' + y = 0. To solve this equation, we would need to specify two initial conditions, like y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0. This is because the equation is second-order, meaning it involves the second derivative of y.\n\n**Linear vs. Nonlinear Differential Equations**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nA linear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable and its derivatives appear in a linear combination. On the other hand, a nonlinear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable or its derivatives appear in a nonlinear combination. But what does this mean in practice? Well, linear differential equations are generally easier to solve, as they can be broken down into simpler components. Nonlinear differential equations, on the other hand, can exhibit more complex behavior, like chaos or bifurcations.\n\nFor example, consider a simple linear differential equation like y' + 2y = 0. This equation can be solved using standard techniques like integrating factors or separation of variables. On the other hand, a nonlinear differential equation like y' + y^2 = 0 can exhibit more complex behavior, like a bifurcation or a limit cycle.\n\n**Initial Conditions and Initial Value Problem**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nAn initial condition is a condition that specifies the value of the dependent variable at a particular point. An initial value problem is a differential equation with one or more initial conditions. But why are initial conditions important? Well, they help us specify the particular solution we're interested in. Think of it like this: if you're trying to navigate a road trip, you need to know where you're starting from and where you're going. In the same way, initial conditions help us determine the specific solution to a differential equation.\n\nFor instance, consider the example of a first-order ODE like y' + 2y = 0. If we specify an initial condition like y(0) = 1, we can use this information to find the particular solution to the equation. Without the initial condition, we would only be able to find the general solution, which would be a family of solutions.\n\n**Direction Fields**\n-------------------\n\nA direction field is a graphical representation of the solutions to a differential equation. It's used to determine the behavior of the solutions. But how does it work? Well, a direction field is like a map that shows us the direction of the solutions at different points. By looking at the direction field, we can get an idea of how the solutions behave, without actually having to solve the equation.\n\nFor example, consider a simple differential equation like y' = x/y. We could use a direction field to visualize the solutions to this equation, and see how they behave as x and y change.\n\n**First-Order Differential Equations**\n--------------------------------------\n\nFirst-order differential equations involve functions of one variable and their first derivatives. Examples include separable, linear, and exact equations. But what are these types of equations, and how do we solve them? Well, separable equations can be solved by separating the variables, while linear equations can be solved using integrating factors. Exact equations, on the other hand, can be solved by recognizing that they can be written in a specific form.\n\nFor instance, consider a simple separable equation like dy/dx = x/y. We can solve this equation by separating the variables, like this: ydy = xdx. Then, we can integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\n**Euler's Method**\n------------------\n\nEuler's method is a numerical method for solving differential equations. It involves approximating the solution at a given point using the solution at a previous point. But how does it work? Well, Euler's method is like a game of \"guess and check\". We start with an initial guess for the solution, and then use the differential equation to approximate the solution at the next point. We keep repeating this process, using the previous solution as our new guess, until we reach the desired level of accuracy.\n\nFor example, consider a simple differential equation like y' = x. We could use Euler's method to approximate the solution to this equation, starting with an initial guess like y(0) = 0. Then, we could use the equation to approximate the solution at the next point, like this: y(1) = y(0) + hf(0), where h is the step size and f is the function on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n**Higher-Order Linear ODEs**\n------------------------------\n\nHigher-order linear ODEs involve functions of one variable and their higher-order derivatives. Examples include constant coefficient second-order linear ODEs and mechanical vibrations. But what are these types of equations, and how do we solve them? Well, constant coefficient second-order linear ODEs can be solved using techniques like the characteristic equation, while mechanical vibrations can be modeled using second-order ODEs.\n\nFor instance, consider a simple mechanical system like a mass-spring-damper. We could use a second-order ODE to model the motion of the mass, taking into account factors like the spring constant, damping coefficient, and initial conditions.\n\n**Laplace Transform**\n---------------------\n\nThe Laplace transform is a method for solving differential equations. It involves transforming the differential equation into an algebraic equation, which can then be solved. But how does it work? Well, the Laplace transform is like a magic trick that helps us turn a difficult differential equation into a simpler algebraic equation. We can then use standard techniques to solve the algebraic equation, and finally transform the solution back to the original variables.\n\nFor example, consider a simple differential equation like y' + 2y = 0. We could use the Laplace transform to solve this equation, by transforming it into an algebraic equation like this: sY(s) - y(0) + 2Y(s) = 0, where Y(s) is the Laplace transform of y(t). We could then solve this equation for Y(s), and finally transform the solution back to the original variable t.\n\n**Power Series Methods**\n-------------------------\n\nPower series methods involve representing the solution to a differential equation as a power series. This can be used to solve linear second-order ODEs and other types of differential equations. But how does it work? Well, power series methods are like a game of \"find the pattern\". We start by assuming that the solution can be written as a power series, and then use the differential equation to find the coefficients of the series.\n\nFor instance, consider a simple differential equation like y'' + y = 0. We could use a power series method to solve this equation, by assuming that the solution can be written as a power series like this: y(x) = \u2211[n=0,\u221e] a_n x^n. We could then use the equation to find the coefficients a_n, and finally write down the solution as a power series.\n\n**Introduction to Separation of Variables and Integrating Factors**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeparation of Variables and Integrating Factors are two important methods used to solve differential equations. These methods are widely used in various fields, including physics, chemistry, and engineering, to solve differential equations that model real-world phenomena. But how do they work? Well, Separation of Variables involves separating the variables to opposite sides of the equation, making it easier to integrate. Integrating Factors, on the other hand, involve multiplying the equation by a factor that makes it exact, allowing for a straightforward solution.\n\nFor example, consider a simple differential equation like dy/dx = x/y. We could use Separation of Variables to solve this equation, by separating the variables like this: ydy = xdx. Then, we could integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\n**Separation of Variables Method**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe Separation of Variables method is used to solve certain types of differential equations by separating the variables to opposite sides of the equation. The equation should be in the form y' = f(x)g(y). But how does it work? Well, we start by separating the variables, and then integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\nFor instance, consider a simple differential equation like dy/dx = x/y. We could use Separation of Variables to solve this equation, by separating the variables like this: ydy = xdx. Then, we could integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\n**Steps for Separation of Variables**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe steps involved in solving a differential equation using Separation of Variables include separating the variables, integrating both sides, and solving for y. But how do we do this in practice? Well, we start by looking at the equation and determining if it can be separated. If it can, we separate the variables and integrate both sides. Finally, we solve for y to find the solution.\n\nFor example, consider a simple differential equation like dy/dx = x/y. We could use the following steps to solve this equation using Separation of Variables:\n\n1. Separate the variables: ydy = xdx\n2. Integrate both sides: \u222bydy = \u222bxdx\n3. Solve for y: y^2/2 = x^2/2 + C\n\n**Integrating Factors Method**\n------------------------------\n\nThe Integrating Factors method is used to solve first-order linear differential equations. An integrating factor is multiplied with the equation to make it exact, thus allowing for a straightforward solution. But how does it work? Well, we start by putting the equation into standard form, and then calculate the integrating factor. We then multiply both sides by the integrating factor, and integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\nFor instance, consider a simple differential equation like dy/dx + 2y = 3. We could use the Integrating Factors method to solve this equation, by following these steps:\n\n1. Put the equation into standard form: dy/dx + 2y = 3\n2. Calculate the integrating factor: \u03bc(x) = e^\u222b2dx = e^2x\n3. Multiply both sides by the integrating factor: \u03bc(x)dy/dx + \u03bc(x)2y = \u03bc(x)3\n4. Integrate both sides: \u222b\u03bc(x)dy/dx dx + \u222b\u03bc(x)2y dx = \u222b\u03bc(x)3 dx\n\n**Steps for Integrating Factors**\n----------------------------------\n\nThe steps involved in solving a first-order linear differential equation using an integrating factor include putting the equation into standard form, calculating the integrating factor, multiplying both sides by the integrating factor, and integrating both sides. But how do we do this in practice? Well, we start by looking at the equation and determining if it is linear. If it is, we put it into standard form and calculate the integrating factor. We then multiply both sides by the integrating factor and integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\nFor example, consider a simple differential equation like dy/dx + 2y = 3. We could use the following steps to solve this equation using an integrating factor:\n\n1. Put the equation into standard form: dy/dx + 2y = 3\n2. Calculate the integrating factor: \u03bc(x) = e^\u222b2dx = e^2x\n3. Multiply both sides by the integrating factor: \u03bc(x)dy/dx + \u03bc(x)2y = \u03bc(x)3\n4. Integrate both sides: \u222b\u03bc(x)dy/dx dx + \u222b\u03bc(x)2y dx = \u222b\u03bc(x)3 dx\n\n**Example of Separation of Variables**\n-------------------------------------\n\nConsider the differential equation dy/dx = x/y. We can use Separation of Variables to solve this equation. But how do we do this in practice? Well, we start by separating the variables, and then integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\nFor instance, we could use the following steps to solve this equation:\n\n1. Separate the variables: ydy = xdx\n2. Integrate both sides: \u222bydy = \u222bxdx\n3. Solve for y: y^2/2 = x^2/2 + C\n\n**Example of Integrating Factors**\n----------------------------------\n\nConsider the differential equation dy/dx + 2y = 3. We can use Integrating Factors to solve this equation. But how do we do this in practice? Well, we start by putting the equation into standard form, and then calculate the integrating factor. We then multiply both sides by the integrating factor, and integrate both sides to find the solution.\n\nFor instance, we could use the following steps to solve this equation:\n\n1.

Multiply both sides by the integrating factor: \u03bc(x)dy/dx + \u03bc(x)2y = \u03bc(x)3\n4. Integrate both sides: \u222b\u03bc(x)dy/dx dx + \u222b\u03bc(x)2y dx = \u222b\u03bc(x)3 dx\n\nIn conclusion, differential equations are a powerful tool for modeling real-world phenomena, and there are many methods for solving them. By understanding the different types of differential equations and the methods for solving them, we can gain insight into a wide range of fields, from physics and engineering to biology and economics.
